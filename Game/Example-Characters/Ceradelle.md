## Ceradelle Of The Red Plains (He/Him)
An elf from a great red grass plain, Ceradelle was raised by a roaming carnival troupe. It was with them that he learned to soothe great beasts and perform incredible routines with his trusty bow and companion dire wolf. As he came of age, however, Ceradelle decided there was more out there, including a family he never knew. Hopefully, along the way, he'll find more interesting beasts and creatures to learn about. 

Ceradelle is an elvish [Beast Master](../Classes#Beast%20Master) [Archer](../Classes#Archer) with fiery eyes, pointed ears and mismatched clothes.
