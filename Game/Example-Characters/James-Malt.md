## James "Scratch" Malt (He/Him)
A down on his luck street magician, Scratch was always trying to get ahead, whether through their specialty of visual magic or more illicit activities. After a hot streak of jobs in a far away city they finally had some money to their name, but also a bounty on their head. They are halfway around the world now, the money is mostly dried up, but nobody seems interested in a bounty two oceans over.

Scratch is a tall [Elementalist](../Classes#Elementalist) [Rogue](../Classes#Rogue) with brown wide eyes, pale skin, tattered medium length hair, and a nice, if ill-fitting, coat.
