## Tesson "Tess" Ravenmark (She/Her)
A powerful warrior from a tribe of spiritualist nomads that believe in migrating with the birds. Tess was born under the symbol of the raven, meaning she was trained to divine the shaping and movement of the wind. When she came of age, her fortunes were read, and it was predicted she would cause a terrible event harming the tribe. With that in mind, she departed trying to avoid the coming calamity, though she tries to remain positive, a deep resentment burns in her for the place the fates have forced her. 

Tess is a [Barbarian](../Classes#Barbarian) [Fortune Teller](../Classes#Fortune%20Teller) with black hair in a long braid, tanned skin, fiery amber eyes, and rough-hewn clothing of poorly refined fabrics.
