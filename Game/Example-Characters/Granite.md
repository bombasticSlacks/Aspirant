## Granite Last-sworn (Any)
Granite, named after their hardy family lineage, was the black sheep of a wealthy family. Granite was never genuinely interested in ruling, being more interested in spending time with the people. After years of disappointment, and pissing away responsibility in a bottle, he was given a small sum and told to depart into the world. Since then, Granite has done the three things she's good at, boxing, drinking, and talking too much.

Granite is a lean and fit [Face](../Classes#Face) [Brawler](../Classes#Brawler) with soft grey eyes, brown semi recently shaved hair, and flowing colourful clothes.
