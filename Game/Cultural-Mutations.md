## Cultural Mutations
Some groups or entities will have specific cultural mutations that make them more powerful, but also have drawbacks or additional requirements for the character. These work similarly to transhumanist effects, but: 

- Doesn’t affect max toxicity. 
- Usually is attached to a group of people.
- Has training to develop it further.
