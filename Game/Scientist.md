## Scientist
One of the 8 [Trades Training](Trades-Training) disciplines.
#TODOcopy 

### Basic
#### Artificer
#TODOcopy 
As [Production Work](Telling-The-Story#Production%20Work), you can create [Prosthetics](Character-Development#Prosthetics) that characters can use with ease.


#### Kill Switch
You can disable automata and machines that you are in melee with using a [Science](Skills#Science) skill test.

#### Mechanic
#TODOcopy 
As [Production Work](Telling-The-Story#Production%20Work), you can create or fix machines.

#### Parabolic Targeting
You can make ranged attack skill tests using the [Science](Skills#Science) skill.

#### Scientific Activation
You can attempt to activate magical items using the [Science](Skills#Science) skill.

#### Specialized Tools
#TODOmigrate 
As an [Evening Activity](Telling-The-Story#Evening%20Activities), you can select a specific [Toolkit](Gear#Toolkits) to pre-prepare. When using that tool kit the next day, you get a +2 to all skill tests.

#### Trapper
#TODOmigrate should be just equipment.
You can create traps and set traps using the crafting skill.

#### Alchemy
As production work you can craft an alchemical potion, medicine or other mixture.

#### Herbology
#TODOmigrate 
Your knowledge extends to regional and magical flora.

#### Gatherer
As production work, you can harvest local flora. Perform a [Variable Difficulty](Skills#Variable%20Difficulty) [Science](Skills#Science) skill test to look for local wild or rare flora. The test for rare flora is at a -2. If you succeed, you receive 1 [Reagents](Resources#Reagents) plus 1 additional per step of success.

### Advanced

#### Jury Rigging
#TODOmigrate 
#TODOcopy 
You can create single-use tools using exceptionally basic materials, simpler than would otherwise be allowed.

#### Multitasker
Once per downtime, you can opt to take a second combat action after your first or expedite / multitask two narrative actions.

#### Alchemical Traps
If your character has a [Trap Kit](Example-Gear#Trap%20Kit), your payloads can be much more exotic, but the skill test becomes [Science](Skills#Science), and they take longer to prepare. They can include things like:
Gravity destabilize: Everything in the trap area loses gravity for 1d3 rounds. Or gravity shifts in a direction for the same duration.
Stasis discharge: Everything in the area is stunned for a turn.
Magnesium Bomb: Everything in the area suffers an exothermic attack that causes a critical injury to a location and is on fire.
Corrosive Gas: Everything in the area loses all resistance for its armour

#### Exact Dosage
Whenever you administer an alchemical solution with a duration, if the duration is rolled for in rounds, roll twice and take the result of your choice. If the solution's duration is not rolled for, you can choose for it to last either half or twice as long. If the solution's effect is immediate, you can choose to use only half the amount.

#### Mutagenics
#TODOcopy
As [Production Work](Telling-The-Story#Production%20Work), you can manipulate and prepare mutagenic compounds for installation.

### Master

#### Vitruvian
Your body is perfect and loses all scarring. Immune to poison, mutations you take don’t have any obvious signs. Going above your Max Toxicity temporarily doesn’t cause injury (though you still can’t take more modifications than that).
