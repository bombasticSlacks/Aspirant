#### Explorers Kit
_A collection of generic items an adventurer should have packed. Whether it be rope, a specific tool, climbing pitons, a torch etc. This kit is by far the most generic, but also any use of the explorers' kit should expend a use and require refilling, as the tools will be subpar. 1 size of [[Metal#Artisan Metals]] + [[Charges]]._

- Cost 11.
- [[3|[Charges]].
- [[Charges]] cost 2 silver to replace.
- Can be used as a 1 use substitute tool you need for an [[Terminology#Action]].
