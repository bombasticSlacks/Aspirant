#### Inverting Backpack
*A normal enough looking backpack, but feels like a different texture on the inside.*

| [General Storage](Game/Storage#General%20Storage) | 8 + [Strength](Game/Core/Strength) |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [Quick Access](Game/Storage#Quick%20Access)       | 4                                  |
| [Camp Storage](Game/Storage#Camp%20Storage)       | 8                                  |
| [Specialization](Game/Storage#Specialization)     | -                                  |

Once obtained you can place a second [Storage](Game/Storage) item inside of it which becomes its other side. Given about 15 seconds you can turn the inverting backpack inside out to get access to the other [Storage](Game/Storage) and its contents and vice versa.
