#### Inverting Backpack
*A normal enough looking backpack, but feels like a different texture on the inside.*

| [[Storage#General Storage]] | 8 + [[Strength]] |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [[Storage#Quick Access]]       | 4                                  |
| [[Storage#Camp Storage]]       | 8                                  |
| [[Storage#Specialization]]     | -                                  |

Once obtained you can place a second [[Storage]] item inside of it which becomes its other side. Given about 15 seconds you can turn the inverting backpack inside out to get access to the other [[Storage]] and its contents and vice versa.
