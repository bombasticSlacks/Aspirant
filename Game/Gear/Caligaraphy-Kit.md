#### Calligaraphy Kit
_A collection of stamps, plates, glossy paper and inks required to create official documents. 1 size of [[Materials#Exotic]] material + [[Charges]]._

- Cost 25.
- Creating a document is a [[Intelligence#Application]] [[Skills#Fixed Difficulty]] skill test with a [[Terminology#Difficulty Value]] assigned based on the complexity of the document. The cost in charges for the creation is equal to 2 \* the [[Terminology#Difficulty Value]].
- [[15|[Charges]].
- [[Charges]] cost 1 silver to replace.

> So, a -4 difficulty test would result in a forgery costing 8 silver.
