## Material
All things are made up of materials. This usually isn't a major concern to the average adventurer, but a savvy tradesman will want to carefully select materials of varying qualities for their projects. Characters will need to source materials for anything they are [Crafting](Crafting). Materials should be simple and interchangeable within a quality.

### Material Quality
All materials generally come in three quality levels:

#### Basic
Simple materials, not very useful for crafting anything but the most basic of things.
#### Artisan
Well treated, high-quality materials used for proper tools and equipment.
#### Exotic
Impressive materials, sourced from unique locations and situations with powerful properties.

### Material Types
There are generally 8 types of materials that will be used for creating:
* [Bits](Bits)
* [Flora](Flora)
* [Hide](Hide)
* [Liquid](Liquid)
* [Metal](Metal)
* [Resonant](Resonant)
* [Textiles](Textiles)
* [Wood](Wood)
## Specificity
Unless the task you need a material for is exceptionally powerful, you should try to avoid specificity. Mutating a character to have cat-like eyes might require specifically eyes from a were-cat, but a potion of night sight should require any artisan bit + artisan liquid.
