## Material
All things are made up of materials. This usually isn't a major concern to the average adventurer, but a savvy tradesman will want to carefully select materials of varying qualities for their projects. Characters will need to source materials for anything they create. Materials should be simple and interchangeable within a quality.

### Material Quality
All materials generally come in three quality levels:

#### Basic
Simple materials, not very useful for crafting anything but the most basic of things.
#### Artisan
Well treated, high-quality materials used for proper tools and equipment.
#### Exotic
Impressive materials, sourced from unique locations and situations with powerful properties.

### Material Types
There are generally 8 types of materials that will be used for creating:
* [Bits](Bits)
* [Flora](Flora)
* [Hide](Hide)
* [Liquid](Liquid)
* [Metal](Metal)
* [Resonant](Resonant)
* [Textiles](Textiles)
* [Wood](Wood)
## Specificity
Unless the task you need a material for is exceptionally powerful, you should try to avoid specificity. Mutating a character to have cat-like eyes might require specifically eyes from a were-cat, but a potion of night sight should require any artisan bit + artisan liquid.
