# Running The Game
Rules primarily for the GM related to running a game of Aspirant.

# Settlements
Creating a new settlement is very easy in Aspirant.

## Size
Determine the settlement size to begin with between size 1-5.

|Size|Example|Population|
|---|---|---|
|1|Outpost, Farmstead|1 - 20|
|2|Village|20-40|
|3|Town|40-200|
|4|City|200-2000|
|5|Capital|2000+|

## Trades
Any location will have some amount of skilled tradesmen or otherwise useful characters. As well as people to help a character develop their skills. A settlement's Max Skill is the maximum level a person could train a skill there without having to do narrative leg work. 

|Size|Trades / Guilds|Max Skill|
|---|---|---|
|1|1|1|
|2|2|2|
|3|4|2|
|4|1 whole group, 8 others|3|
|5|All|3|

These trades should have buildings, facilities and representatives that shape the area and its priorities.

## Settlement Rankings
When characters do something inside a settlement they may need to see if the settlement provides or responds. To do this you would roll the Settlement Size + Relevant Ranking similar to a skill test to see if something happens. 

Rankings come in 3 levels 0-3 just like player skills and if a settlement has a ranking of 0 it performs the test at a -2.

To randomize rankings for a settlement you can roll 1d6 for each ranking and check the following chart:

|Roll|Ranks|
|---|---|
|1-2|0|
|3-4|1|
|5|2|
|6|3|

### Policing
How fast are soldiers, bounty hunters, or other enforcers deployed to stop crime, and how seriously are they equipped?

Roll Policing when something illegal happens and might be reported, or to determine how secure a location or area is.

### Wealth
How wide is trade? What commodities and rarities are available in this settlement.

Roll Wealth when a character wants to determine if a specific item is available for them to purchase or barter for.

### Danger
How threatening a place is. What gangs and dangerous people lurk in the shadows.

Roll Danger when a character has put themselves in a situation where harm or risk could come to them.

### Culture
How many activities of interest are going on. What kind of religious and regional festivals take place.

Roll Culture when determining random events or interesting happenstances for a settlement.

### Migration
How standardized the culture and people are. How much would travellers and adventurers stick out when arriving?

Roll Migration when a character might do something to draw attention or would cause a rumour to spread.

## Leadership
The city will be run by some person or group. This could be inherited from the region or unique. Some ideas are:

## Traits
Settlements size 3 and above will potentially have interesting traits that affect how they work. Generally, a random settlement can have 1 trait, but some specialized settlements may have more than 1.
