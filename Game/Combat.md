## Combat
Combat in Aspirant is more structured than standard narrative time, since it is also more high stakes. Combat is broken up into [Combat Rounds](Terminology#Combat%20Round). During which, you will get a [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) to do things.

### Initiative Value
A [Reflexes](Agility#Reflexes) [Variable Difficulty](Skills#Variable%20Difficulty) test, where your [Steps Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success)/failure are compared to everyone else's. Your initiative value determines what order people will perform their [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) during the [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round). So even though all characters are acting simultaneously in combat, as an abstraction, people still go in a specific order.

> So if you are fighting someone, you both perform a [Reflexes](Agility#Reflexes) test. You get a 13 meaning 3 [Step Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success), they get a 8 meaning 2 steps of failure. That means you act first in the [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round).

### Area Of Effect
In general, most things will only target a single person, however if something (such as a spell) refers to a square or cone of damage. A 9m square means a square with a side length of 9m. You would choose where you want it and if you miss your attack it scatters in a random direction equal to the number you failed by in meters. Determine what direction it scatters at random.

### Being in Melee Combat
If you perform a melee attack (whether it’s successful) on an enemy or they perform an [Attack](Terminology#Attack) on you then you are both considered in melee. Anyone who performs a melee attack on anyone in a melee joins the melee. During a melee, narratively your characters are moving around and connecting weapons, though mechanically your character is rooted in place. Any time you attempt to move, back out, or cautious step you are no longer in the melee, but this may cause people to hurt you as you stop defending to escape. While in a melee, if the enemies are outnumbered you get a +1 on all combat rolls related to the melee and if they are outnumbered more than 2 to 1 you get a +2.

While in melee, you are at a negative to use ranged weapons equal to the largest enemy threat. 

### Being in Cover
If there is an object of some kind between yourself and an opponent, you count as “in cover”. This provides you with protection from incoming attacks.

If you are behind cover and not attacking or otherwise doing something it is assumed, you are fully covered. Anyone shooting at you gets a -2 as you are not visible, and your entire body is protected by the cover.

If you are shooting from behind cover unless you have some special abilities you require your dominant arm chest and head exposed. When you are shot when you determine hit location if any of those locations are targeted you are hit normally otherwise your cover protects you. You may opt to blind fire while in cover which is a ranged attack at -4 but only requires your dominant arm to be outside cover.

You do not gain the benefits of cover if you are in melee.

If you are protected by cover, any attack against you must first penetrate the cover to be able to harm you (this stacks with your armour). Most pieces of cover only have 1 armour integrity and will be unable to protect you after the first shot.
