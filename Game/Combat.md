# Combat
Combat in Aspirant is more structured than standard narrative time, since it is also more high stakes. Combat is broken up into [Combat Rounds](Terminology#Combat%20Round). During which, you will get a [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) to do things.

## Initiative Value
A [Reflexes](Agility#Reflexes) [Variable Difficulty](Skills#Variable%20Difficulty) test, where your [Steps Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success)/failure are compared to everyone else's. Your initiative value determines what order people will perform their [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) during the [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round). So even though all characters are acting simultaneously in combat, as an abstraction, people still go in a specific order.

> So if you are fighting someone, you both perform a [Reflexes](Agility#Reflexes) test. You get a 13 meaning 3 [Step Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success), they get a 8 meaning 2 steps of failure. That means you act first in the [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round).
