## Combat
### Combat Turns
Combat in Aspirant is more structured than standard narrative time, since it is also more high stakes. Combat is broken up into combat turns. During each 5 second combat turn, you get a personal turn to take an action.

### Initiative Value
Initiative value is your [Initiative](Stats#Initiative)+ 1d6. Your initiative value determines what order people will act in when combat happens. So even though all characters are acting simultaneously in combat, as an abstraction, people still go in a specific order.

### Your Turn
On Your turn in combat, you can do basically anything that can feasibly be done in 5 seconds. You are encouraged to get creative and talk to the GM; however, several common manoeuvres are listed in this chapter for you to use as examples. The simple way to think about it though is on your turn, you can either:
- Do an Action (usually involves a skill test)
- Move up to 2 * AGI meters, then do an action with all skill tests at -2
- Delay your combat turn

When you delay your combat turn, you can instead choose to act after any other character has finished their combat turn. You need to use your delayed action before your next combat turn (this can lead to you taking back to back turns).

### Advanced Turns
There are some advanced things that may become available to you as your character develops that require you to do other things on your turn.

Free actions such as imbibing medicine, declaring combat stances, talking, etc. These free actions need to (unless otherwise specified) be performed before your action.

Control Allies or other characters. If you have allies or other characters they will usually act on your turn and during your turn you can choose in what order you all act. However, after starting a character's turn you must finish it before moving on to another character.

### Drawing Equipment and Weapons
Your character typically has 3 types of storage: [belt](Storage#Belt), [Backpack](Storage#Backpack), [Saddlebag](Storage#Saddlebag). These all have different costs for drawing.

### Movement
In general, your movement is as simple as going up to your [Move Speed](Stats#Move%20Speed) in any direction. 

#### Standing Up
If you are prone, it takes the entirety of your available movement to stand up. 

#### Avoiding Obstacles
If there are obstacles in the way of a movement, you can test [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) or [Fitness](Fitness) to attempt to ignore them. Otherwise, you must spend a full turn of movement getting over the obstacles.

### Attacking
Usually, in combat, you will be trying to harm your opponents with the goal of killing or disabling them. Attacks will typically be thrown attacks (STR + Marksmanship), ranged attacks (AGI + Marksmanship), melee attacks (STR + Melee), or magic attacks (Res + Evoke).

### Attack Range
When you attack something, your range is how far you can engage them from. With melee weapons, you need to be within 2m. With Range, Thrown, and Magic you have a range, but it is possible to attack outside of it. When you do, you suffer a -1 penalty to the skill test per total range they are away from you. Magic attacks have a range of 10m, Thrown have a range of 3 times your STR, Ranged attacks will be defined in the weapons traits.

#### Attacking
- Declare what weapon you are using
- Make sure you are within range (or figure out what your total penalty will be) 
- Determine any bonuses or negatives you have on the attack.
- Declare any modifiers you are applying to the attack.
- Roll a skill test. If you fail this test, the attack fails.
- If your attack doesn’t target a specific location, roll the hit location dice to determine where you hit.
- Your opponent can at this point attempt to avoid your attack if they would like to and have a reaction available. If they avoid, the attack fails.
- You compare the penetration value on your attack to the armour value of the limb you are trying to hit (this will be covered in depth later in this chapter). If you fail to penetrate, the attack fails.
- Roll a d6, add any relevant damage bonuses, and consult the damage chart for what corresponding injury they will take.

### Combat Bonuses and Negatives
These are common bonuses and negatives you can receive on your attacks which will make attacking easier. This is not an exhaustive list and sometimes if you feel you are advantaged over your opponent, you should express this to your GM, and they may give you additional bonuses. As well, some combat bonuses can be learned by taking specific martial arts, combat training, or having specific pieces of equipment.
* Charging: When making a melee attack or manoeuvre, if you have moved at least 3 meters towards your opponent you get a +1 to the skill test.
* Shooting Position: If when shooting you are in a comfortable position you get a +1 to the skill test.
* Outnumbered: If your opponent is outnumbered in melee, you receive a +1 to melee attacks and manoeuvres against them
* Severely Outnumbered: If your opponents are outnumbered in melee by more than 2 to 1 you receive a +2 to melee attacks and manoeuvres against them. (ex: 3 to 1, 5 to 2 etc.)
* Unaware: When making an attack or manoeuvre, if your opponent is unaware of your presence, you get a +4 to the skill test.
* On The Move: If you have moved this turn, you take a -2 to your ranged attacks and manoeuvres.
* Unweighted for Throwing: If you attempt to throw a weapon that doesn’t have the thrown tag you receive a -3 on the skill test. Basic weapons only have a -1 penalty.
* On Your Back: When attempting a melee test, if you are prone you receive a -2.

### Combat Modifiers
These are modifiers you can apply to attacks and manoeuvres which will put you at a negative to the skill test but will make the attack or manoeuvre do additional things. Several other powerful modifiers can be learned by taking specific martial arts or combat training. 
#### Called Shot
Your attack has a guaranteed hit location. -2 for arm or leg shots, -1 for chest shots, -3 for headshots.
#### Difficult Hit
You make your attacks harder to predict and therefore harder to avoid. You can give yourself a -1, -3 or -5 to your skill test to give your opponent a similar negative to any reactions.
#### Reposition
before making a melee attack or manoeuvre, you can move to a different side of your opponent. Puts the attack/manoeuvre at a -1.

### Special Manoeuvres
These are attacks or abilities that any trained fighter can use. This isn’t an exhaustive list of everything you can do in combat but includes some of the manoeuvres that tend to come up a lot. Any manoeuvre which affects an enemy combatant is considered an attack (such as for determining if you are in melee). A number of other powerful manoeuvres can be learned by taking specific martial arts or combat training. When reasonable [Combat Modifiers](#Combat%20Modifiers) and [Combat Bonuses and Negatives](#Combat%20Bonuses%20and%20Negatives) are applied to these regularly.
#### Back out
You make an [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) skill test to step out of melee with an opponent. If you succeed, you can move agility * 2 meters and then perform an action at a -2 (as normal). If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity and then may do that anyway.
#### Cautious Step
You move out of melee with an enemy without provoking an attack of opportunity. You can move up to your agility * 2 meters, but no other actions.
#### Disarm
With at least one free hand or a melee weapon, you can attempt to disarm someone. Make a melee attack at -1 and if successful, your opponent drops their weapon (or it is now in your hands).
#### Grapple
Make an attack with the intent of getting control of your opponent. If you successfully hit, your opponent is in a grapple. They have to spend their turn succeeding an [Strength](Stats#Strength) + [Fitness](Fitness) or [Agility](Stats#Agility) + [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) test with a negative equal to your [Melee](Melee) skill, or remain grappled. On your turn, you may:
* Make a Strength + Fitness test to inflict a severe injury to them, ignoring armour.
* Pin then completely skipping your turn and their next turn
* Make an attack with a size 1 weapon with a -2 to hit that can’t be evaded
* Make an STR + Fitness test to throw them strength + d3 meters in a direction of your choice|
#### Overwatch
Declare a 45-degree cone in front of you. If anyone moves into that area, you make a ranged attack on them, and they take a -2 on their action. Your attack is at -2.
#### Parry
Which is a melee skill test at (-2) where if you succeed, then if an enemy attacks you in melee and succeeds, you ignore the attack. If they fail their skill test to attack, you deal damage to them.
#### Shove
With at least one free hand, you can attempt to move someone. Make a melee attack, and you can move them up to your strength in meters. If they hit something, they become knocked down.

---

### Reacting to Attacks
During each full turn of combat, each character gets a single reaction, which they can use when something else happens during combat. Your reaction refreshes on your turn. In general, these are used to avoid incoming attacks. The generally available reactions are:

#### Block
A melee skill test at (-2) where if you succeed, you ignore damage and other effects from a melee attack. The attack still counts as hitting you (this can be relevant for certain effects).

#### Dodge
An [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) skill test at (-2) where if you succeed then an enemy attack doesn’t hit you. You cannot dodge while prone.

#### Move to Cover
An [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) skill test (0) where if you succeed then you may move to a piece of cover within agility meters before an enemy ranged attack is calculated. You cannot Move to Cover while prone.

#### Attack of Opportunity
A melee skill test at (-2) which you may perform if someone moves while in melee with you. If successful, you can resolve an attack against them, which they cannot dodge.

#### All Out Attack
Declare that you forgo your reaction for the turn to get a +2 on an action on your turn.

### Hit Locations
Hit locations are usually simplified to head, body, dominant arm, nondominant arm, legs.

To randomly determine a hit location, you should roll a d12 and consult the following chart. This also matches up with hit location dice that are readily available for many other pen and paper RPGs.

| D12  | Location         |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| 1-4  | Chest            |
| 5-6  | Dominant Arm     |
| 7-8  | Non-Dominant Arm |
| 9-11 | Legs             |
| 12   | Head             |

### Armour and Penetration
When someone is being attacked, to determine what effect the attack has, you check if the incoming damage type is either a weakness or resistance of the armour:

Damage type is a weakness: 
- Armour does nothing, character is injured.

Damage type is neither a weakness nor a resistance: 
- Remove two armour integrity, you are not injured.

Damage type is a resistance: 
- Remove one armour integrity, you are not injured.
- If you are injured, reduce the injury type by one level.

**Note** Any time you would remove an integrity, but your armour's integrity is 0 you receive an injury instead.

### Dealing Damage
When you or something else is attempting to injure someone you will in most cases roll 1d6 + damage modifier. Damage modifier is a combination of the weapons inherent lethality, size, any bonuses from your character and usually your STR. 

This number is usually compared to the universal damage chart to determine the injury caused:

|       |          |
| ----- | -------- |
| Roll  | Injury   |
| 1-5   | Minimal  |
| 6-10  | Severe   |
| 11-15 | Critical |
| 16+   | Lethal   |
```
So, for example, a long sword (3 size martial weapon) wielded by a character with 3 STR would have a damage bonus of 7 (1 martial + 3 size + 3 STR). That means on a 1-3 it causes a severe injury, on a 4-6 it causes a critical injury. 
```

### Types of Damage
Generally, there are two large categories of damage – Physical and Otherworldly, each of these then further has three categories of damage.

Physical injuries can consist of -
- Rending – tearing and cutting flesh
- Piercing – stabbing and piercing flesh
- Impact – slamming into and breaking flesh 

Otherworldly injuries can consist of -
- Biological – poison, acid, and rot ravage the body
- Exothermic – heat, power, holy energy ravage the body 
- Endothermic – ice, cold, vampiric energy ravage the body

### Area Of Effect
In general, most things will only target a single person however if something (such as a spell) refers to a square or cone of damage. A 9m square means a square with a side length of 9m. You would choose where you want it and if you miss your attack it scatters in a random direction equal to the number you failed by in meters. Determine what direction it scatters at random.

### Being in Melee Combat
If you perform a melee attack (whether it’s successful) on an enemy or they perform an attack on you (whether it’s successful) then you are both considered in melee. Anyone who performs a melee attack on anyone in a melee joins the melee. During a melee narratively your characters are moving around and connecting weapons though mechanically your character is rooted in place. Any time you attempt to move, back out, or cautious step you are no longer in the melee but this may cause people to hurt you as you stop defending to escape. While in a melee if the enemies are outnumbered you get a +1 on all combat rolls related to the melee and if they are outnumbered more than 2 to 1 you get a +2.

While in melee, you are at a negative to use ranged weapons equal to the largest enemy threat. 

### Being in Cover
If there is an object of some kind between yourself and an opponent, you count as “in cover”. This provides you with protection from incoming attacks.

If you are behind cover and not attacking or otherwise doing something it is assumed, you are fully covered. Anyone shooting at you gets a -2 as you are not visible, and your entire body is protected by the cover.

If you are shooting from behind cover unless you have some special abilities you require your dominant arm chest and head exposed. When you are shot when you determine hit location if any of those locations are targeted you are hit normally otherwise your cover protects you. You may opt to blind fire while in cover which is a ranged attack at -4 but only requires your dominant arm to be outside cover.

You do not gain the benefits of cover if you are in melee.

If you are protected by cover, any attack against you must first penetrate the cover to be able to harm you (this stacks with your armour). Most pieces of cover only have 1 armour integrity and will be unable to protect you after the first shot.
