# Injury
Humans don’t have hit points. A character's armour takes the role of their safety net to injury, once it is gone when attacked and harmed you suffer injuries. [Damage](Terminology#Damage) converts to injuries as follows:

| Damage | Injury                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 1      | [Minimal Injury](#Minimal%20Injury)   |
| 2      | [Severe Injury](#Severe%20Injury)     |
| 3      | [Critical Injury](#Critical%20Injury) |
| 4+     | [Lethal Injury](#Lethal%20Injury)     |

> Example a character suffers an attack that deals 2 damage, while not wearing armour, they suffer a [Severe Injury](#Severe%20Injury). If they then suffer an attack that deals 3 damage, they suffer an additional [Critical Injury](#Critical%20Injury).

All injuries will potentially cause an [Injury-Effects](Injury-Effects).
## Minimal Injury
An attack that doesn't cause serious wounds, but still causes disruption.
* Must perform [Endurance](Strength#Endurance) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty) (0) or suffer an [Injury-Effects](Injury-Effects).

## Severe Injury
Severe injuries need medical attention quickly. It can involve broken bones, internal bleeding, and severe lacerations. After taking a severe injury, there is only so long you can fight before you pass out. 
* Must perform [Endurance](Strength#Endurance) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty) (0) or suffer an [Injury-Effects](Injury-Effects).
* Become [Wounded](Effects#Wounded).
* You will die from complications without [Stabilization](#Stabilization) in 30–60 minutes.

## Critical Injury
Critical injuries pose an immediate threat to your life. You are left severely bleeding, unconscious, with organ failure, etc. as well you will have completely lost use of the attacked area which will need to be replaced with [Prosthetics](Character-Development#Prosthetics) or reattached/fixed by a [Surgeon](Academic#Surgeon).
* Suffer an [Injury-Effects](Injury-Effects).
* Become [Wounded](Effects#Wounded).
* Critical [Vitals](#Vitals) injuries kill outright.
* You will die from complications without [Stabilization](#Stabilization) in 3–5 minutes.

## Lethal Injury
A lethal injury always means death to a normal-sized creature and represents a complete failure of their necessary systems for survival. 
* Death

## Hit Locations
Generally when considering where something strikes you, it is assumed that an [Attack](Terminology#Attack) or other harm will hit you in somewhere that will not kill you. Important vitals locations are often close to the body, and hard to strike without intent. The two location types are:
### Ancillary
Ancillary are any standard [Attack](Terminology#Attack). An ancillary attack can still be very dangerous, but should not have the potential to outright kill.
### Vitals
Vitals are an [Attack](Terminology#Attack) that is targeted, usually with [Vitals Shot](Attacks#Vitals%20Hit). The meaningful distinction is that a [Critical Injury](#Critical%20Injury) to the vitals, will kill you outright.

## Types of Damage
Generally, there are two large categories of damage – Physical and Otherworldly, each of these then further has three categories of damage.

Physical injuries can consist of:
### Rending
tearing and cutting flesh.
### Piercing
Stabbing and piercing flesh.
### Impact
Slamming into and breaking flesh .

---

Otherworldly injuries can consist of:
### Life
Poison, acid, and rot ravage the body, destroying life itself.
### Heat
Heat, power, holy energy ravage the body 
### Cold
Ice, chill, vampiric energy ravage the body

## Heroes
Your characters are heroes. Heroes can’t instantly die from an attack. Any attack that would kill a hero outright, instead leaves the character [Defeated](Effects#Defeated).

## Injury Penalty
After someone is wounded, whether they pass out or stay conscious, they will suffer long-term effects. Once the combat ends, you will take negatives to any skill tests. Critical injuries give a -3 to all tests, and Severe injuries give a -2 to all tests. This lasts until your characters does [Injury Recovery](Activities#Injury%20Recovery).

## Managing Injuries
Aside from the trauma of being injured in the field, there are other immediate risks to a person who has been injured, and they will need treatment to stay healthy or remain alive (depending on severity).

When determining difficulty of [Application](Intelligence#Application) skill tests and negatives for any injuries, you just count the injury that would give you the largest negative/penalty. Multiple injuries don’t provide cumulative negatives.

### Stabilization
Even if you aren’t trained in [Application](Intelligence#Application) and don't have the proper tools you may still attempt to stabilize someone's injuries. This is a very basic test which means they are no longer bleeding, their burns have been covered, etc. This is a [Application](Intelligence#Application) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(0). No matter the result of the skill test, the person is no longer at risk of immediately dying, but they get an additional -1 to their [injury penalty](#Lingering%20Pain).
