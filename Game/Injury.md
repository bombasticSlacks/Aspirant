| Injury Type     | Immediate Effect | Become Wounded | Chance Of Death                              |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Minimal Injury  | If Fail Strength | No             | No                                           |
| Severe Injury   | If Fail Strength | Yes            | No                                           |
| Critical Injury | Yes              | Yes            | Guaranteed In Head, Chance In Body (Resolve) |
| Lethal Injury   | Death            | Yes            | Always                                       |

Humans don’t have hit points. A character's armour takes the role of their safety net to injury, once it is gone when attacked and harmed you suffer injuries. Whenever something is injured the injury can be of the magnitude of: None (N), Mimal Injury (M), Severe Injury (S), Critical Injury (C), Lethal Injury (L).

#### Minimal Injury (M)
An attack that causes a minimal injury causing bleeding, bruising or burns. After taking a minimal injury you will usually need to make a strength test to not immediately fall over, collapse, drop what you were holding etc.

#### Severe Injury (S) 
Severe injuries need medical attention quickly. Can involve broken bones, and severe lacerations. After taking a severe injury there is only so long you can fight before you pass out. After taking a severe injury you will usually need to make a strength test to not immediately fall over, collapse, drop what you were holding etc. Also consider yourself Wounded.

#### Critical Injury (C)
Critical injuries pose an immediate threat to your life. You are left severely bleeding, unconscious, burning, etc. as well you will have completely lost use of the damaged limb which will need to be replaced and you will suffer the negative effect of the injury (no strength test to resist). If you take a critical injury to the chest you must make a resolve test or die. A critical injury to the head immediately kills you. Consider yourself Wounded your resolve test starts at -1.

#### Lethal Injury (L) 
A lethal injury always means death to a normal sized creature and represents a complete failure or their necessary systems for survival. Usually weapons that cause immediate death are known for their large amounts of collateral damage.

### Immediate Effects

Immediate effects are what happens to you immediately as you are harmed by an enemy. All injury types inflict one of these but you will sometimes get to roll to ignore the effect. The usual immediate effects to each limb are as follows: 

| Body Part | Effect                                                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legs      | Knocked Prone, -1 to movement rating next turn.                  |
| Arms      | Drop What you are holding, -1 to actions with that arm next turn |
| Chest     | -2 to all actions next turn                                      |
| Head      | Stunned for 1 turn                                               |

### Bleeding and Burning
In general, rending and piercing weapons that cause severe and critical injuries will cause bleeding as will critical impact injuries. Exothermic injuries will catch you on fire.

A person will die of blood loss if they don’t receive first aid or stabilization within 10 minutes of blood loss from a severe injury and will die within 3 minutes of blood loss from a critical injury if they don’t receive first aid or stabilization.

Assuming you have been put out, burns will not immediately kill you but are a risk for later.

### Being Wounded
If your character is injured, they only have so long before they pass out/collapse. In general on each combat turn you are wounded after you have performed your action you make a resolve + heroism test to see if you can continue to fight at a reasonable level (the use of medication and stabilization can cause you to ignore this). If you fail this test you fall unconscious. For every severe injury after the first add a -1 to the test for every critical injury add -2 to the test.

### Lingering Pain
After someone is Wounded, whether they pass out or stay conscious they will suffer long term effects. Once the combat ends you will take negatives to any skill tests. Critical injuries give a -3 to all tests and Severe injuries give a -2 to all tests. This lasts until your characters rest.

### Surviving Injuries
At the end of a quest if you were wounded you should roll to determine how bad the lasting effects of your injuries were. Make a resolve + heroism test with a +2 for being stabilized, a +2 for a successful surgery, a -1 for a critical injury, a -1 for a failed surgery, and a -1 if you did not receive long term care when you could have. Based on your result the following will occur:

| Roll | Effect                                                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-3  | You die of complications                                                              |
| 4-6  | Torturous hospitalization: lose your recreation time and take another mental fatigue. |
| 7-8  | Severe infection: lose your recreation time. Limb needs to be amputated.              |
| 9-10 | Local infection: your limb needs to be amputated (if not already removed)             |
| 11+  | You are fine and recover normally                                                     |
