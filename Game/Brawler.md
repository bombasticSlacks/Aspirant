### Flesh Prison

## Advanced

### Adrenaline Response
After suffering an [Injury](Core/Injury.md) that would make you [Wounded](Core/Effects.md#Wounded), you immediately get to take an additional [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology.md#Combat%20Turn) (in addition to your regular turn).

### Clothesline
If an [Opponent](Core/Terminology.md#Opponent) moves within [Reach](Core/Movement.md#Reach) of you, you may spend a [Reaction](Core/Terminology.md#Reaction) to make a [Strike](Core/Strength.md#Strike) [Opposed Difficulty](Core/Skills.md#Opposed%20Difficulty)([Strike](Core/Strength.md#Strike)+2), that if successful causes their attack to fail and knocks them prone.

> So the skill test would be at a (-4) penalty against someone with 2 ranks in [Strike](Core/Strength.md#Strike)

### Dragon Rush
After doing an [Attack](Core/Terminology.md#Attack) while unarmed, if you havenâ€™t already used this training this [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology.md#Combat%20Turn), you may use a [Reaction](Core/Terminology.md#Reaction) to perform another attack or manoeuvre.

### Drunk Boxing
You may [Parry](Core/Special-Combat-Actions.md#Parry) with a [Mannerism](Core/Communication.md#Mannerism) [Fixed Difficulty(-2)](Core/Skills.md#Fixed%20Difficulty).

### Enrage

* +1 [Strength](Core/Strength.md)
* -1 [Intelligence](Core/Intelligence.md)
* +2 to [Endurance](Core/Strength.md#Endurance) tests
* Ignore [Being Wounded](Core/Effects.md#Wounded)

On any [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology.md#Combat%20Turn) where you don't make an [Attack](Core/Terminology.md#Attack), you must roll a d6, on a 1-3 you stop being enraged.

### Relentless Attack
When making an [All Out Attack](Core/Reacting-To-Attacks.md#All%20Out%20Attack), if it is an [Injuring Attack](Core/Terminology.md#Injuring%20Attack) you deal the next more severe type of [Injury](Core/Injury.md#Injury).

### Thunderous Charge
Your [Charging](Core/Attack-Bonuses.md#Charging) attacks have the [Penetrating](Core/Weapon-Traits.md#Penetrating) trait.
