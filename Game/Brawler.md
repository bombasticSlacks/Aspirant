Whenever someone you are [In Melee](Core/Effects#In%20Melee) with performs a [Mitigated Attack](Core/Terminology#Mitigated%20Attack) against you, you may spend a [Reaction](Core/Terminology#Reaction) to make an [Attack](Core/Terminology#Attack) with a hit location of the limb they attacked with.

### Terrify
After a [Successful Attack](Core/Terminology#Successful%20Attack) [In Melee](Core/Effects#In%20Melee), you can spend a [Reaction](Core/Terminology#Reaction) to intimidate an enemy with a [Mannerism](Core/Communication#Mannerism) [Opposed Difficulty](Core/Skills#Opposed%20Difficulty)([Identity](Core/Spirit#Identity)).

## Advanced

### Adrenaline Response
After suffering an [Injury](Core/Injury) that would make you [Wounded](Core/Effects#Wounded), you immediately get to take an additional [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology#Combat%20Turn) (in addition to your regular turn). After this [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology#Combat%20Turn), you then return to the standard [Combat Round](Core/Terminology#Combat%20Round) order, including resolving the results of your injuries.

### Cleave
If you cause a [wounding attack](Core/Terminology#Wounding%20Attack), on a [Character](Core/Terminology#Character) you are [In Melee](Core/Effects#In%20Melee), you may make an additional [Attack](Core/Terminology#Attack) against another enemy with the same weapon and [Combat Modifiers](Core/Attacks#Combat%20Modifiers).

### Clothesline
If an [Opponent](Core/Terminology#Opponent) moves within [Reach](Core/Movement#Reach) of you, you may spend a [Reaction](Core/Terminology#Reaction) to make a [Strike](Core/Strength#Strike) [Opposed Difficulty](Core/Skills#Opposed%20Difficulty)([Strike](Core/Strength#Strike)+2), that if successful causes their attack to fail and knocks them prone.

> So the skill test would be at a (-4) penalty against someone with 2 ranks in [Strike](Core/Strength#Strike)

### Dragon Rush
After doing an [Attack](Core/Terminology#Attack) while unarmed, if you haven’t already used this training this [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology#Combat%20Turn), you may use a [Reaction](Core/Terminology#Reaction) to perform another attack or manoeuvre.

### Drunk Boxing
You may [Parry](Core/Special-Combat-Actions#Parry) with a [Mannerism](Core/Communication#Mannerism) [Fixed Difficulty(-2)](Core/Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty).

### Enrage
When you make a [Strike](Core/Strength#Strike) skill test, spend a [Power](Core/Stats#Max%20Power) to become enraged. While enraged, you have: 
* +1 [Strength](Core/Strength)
* -1 [Intelligence](Core/Intelligence)
* +2 to [Endurance](Core/Strength#Endurance) tests
* Ignore [Being Wounded](Core/Effects#Wounded)

On any [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology#Combat%20Turn) where you don't make an [Attack](Core/Terminology#Attack), you must roll a d6, on a 1-3 you stop being enraged.

### Relentless Attack
When making an [All Out Attack](Core/Reacting-To-Attacks#All%20Out%20Attack), if it is an [Injuring Attack](Core/Terminology#Wounding%20Attack) you deal the next more severe type of [Injury](Core/Injury#Injury).

### Thunderous Charge
Your [Charging](Core/Attack-Bonuses#Charging) attacks have the [Penetrating](Core/Weapon-Traits#Penetrating) trait.
