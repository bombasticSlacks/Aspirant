# Example Weapons
* A non-exhaustive list of weapons a player could use. You can instead design your own [Designing-Weapons](Designing-Weapons).
* Cost is the full charge to commission, including labour.
* Sell is the cost for just the materials, so what it's worth if it was sold in a shop.
* Crafting Cost is different than either of these values, and should be calculated when crafting.
