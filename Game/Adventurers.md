## Adventurers
A way to do [Character-Creation](Character-Creation).

To create a character who is already a knowlegdable adventurer.Â 
* Determine your XP target
* Determine your attributes
* Determine your skills
* Determine starter training
* Purchase progression
* Purchase any gear and work
* Finalize your character

### Determine Your Total XP
First talk to your GM and other players to determine if there is a limit to how much XP the character should spend right now. This can be marked on your sheet as your [Total XP](Stats#Total%20XP).

### Determine Your Attributes
Assign your [Attributes](Stats#Attributes) placing one of the two sets of values in each of the 5 attributes.
* 4,3,2,2,2
* 3,3,3,2,2

> So, 4 STR, 3 AGI, 2 INT, 2 RES, 2 FEL is a valid stat line 

### Determine Your Skills
You can put 6 ranks into skills of your choice, no skill may go above rank 2.

### Determine Starter Training
All characters begin play with 2 basic trainings of their choice.

### Purchase Progression
At this point, you can spend as much of your remaining XP as you would like to. Each training / skill you take does require spending money: [Costs Of Services](Services#Costs%20Of%20Services). Your character can also decide to start with [Cultural-Mutations](Cultural-Mutations).

### Purchase Any Gear And Work
Your characters are guaranteed to begin play with:
* 6 storage [Backpack](Storage#Backpack).
* 4 storage [Belt](Storage#Belt).
* 10 storage [Saddlebag](Storage#Saddlebag).
* [Camping Gear](Example-Gear#Camping%20Gear).
* Size 1, 2, or 3 [Basic](Weapons#Basic) Weapon.
* Set of [Simple Clothes](Example-Gear#Simple%20Clothes) covering your entire body.
* A wild horse [Mount](Mounts) with 1 mobility, 1 toughness, 1 combat.
* $Silver = 50 + 10 * Total\ XP$

You may now, with any remaining money, purchase any equipment your character desires. All equipment should be purchased at full price as though it were commissioned. If you wish to upgrade a piece of gear you were given for free you only need to pay the difference in comissioning.

You also at any point during purchasing get 5 [Downtime Activities](Telling-The-Story#Downtime%20Activities) with which you can either make money, craft equipment, or do something else relevant. They don't need to all be done at once. 
> So you could craft an item you then buy some stuff to upgrade.

### Finalize Your Character
Finally calculate your character other [Additional Attributes](Stats#Additional%20Attributes) and make note of your items and abilities.
