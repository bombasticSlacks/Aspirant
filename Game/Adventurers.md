# Adventurers

A way to do [Character-Creation](Character-Creation).

To create a character who is already a knowledgeable adventurer.

- Determine your XP target
- Determine your attributes
- Determine your skills
- Determine starter training
- Purchase progression
- Purchase any gear and work
- Finalize your character

## Determine Your Total XP

First talk to your GM and other players to determine if there is a limit to how much XP the character should spend right now. This can be marked on your sheet as your [Total XP](Game/Blocks/Total-XP).

## Determine Your Attributes

Assign your [Attributes](Core/Attributes) placing one of the two sets of values in each of the 5 attributes.

- 4,3,2,2,2
- 3,3,3,2,2

> So, 4 [Strength](Core/Strength), 3 [Agility](Core/Agility), 2 [Intelligence](Core/Intelligence), 2 [Spirit](Core/Spirit), 2 [Communication](Core/Communication) is a valid stat line

## Determine Your Skills

You can put 7 ranks into skills of your choice, no skill may go above rank 2.

## Determine Starter Training

All characters begin play with 2 basic [Training](Character-Development#Training) of their choice.

## Purchase Progression

At this point, you can spend as much of your remaining XP as you would like to. Each training / skill you take does not require spending money, the assumption being you already would have spent it: [Costs Of Services](Services#Costs%20Of%20Services). Your character can also decide to start with [Cultural-Mutations](Cultural-Mutations).

## Purchase Any Gear And Work

Your characters are guaranteed to begin play with:

- 6 storage [Backpack](Storage#Backpack).
- 4 storage [Belt](Storage#Belt).
- 10 storage [Saddlebag](Storage#Saddlebag).
- [Camping Gear](Example-Gear#Camping%20Gear).
- Size 1, 2, or 3 [Basic](Core/Weapons#Basic) Weapon.
- Set of [Clothing](Example-Gear#Clothing) covering your entire body.
- A wild horse [Mount](Mounts) with 1 mobility, 1 toughness, 1 combat.
- $Silver = 50 + 10 * Total\ XP$

You may now, with any remaining money, purchase any equipment your character desires. All equipment should be purchased at full price as though it were commissioned. If you wish to upgrade a piece of gear you were given for free, you only need to pay the difference in commissioning.

You also, at any point during purchasing get 5 [Downtime Activities](Activities#Downtime%20Activity) with which you can either make money, craft equipment, or do something else relevant. They don't need to all be done at once.

> So, you could craft an item you then buy some stuff to upgrade.

## Finalize Your Character

Finally calculate your character other [Attributes](Core/Attributes) and make note of your items and abilities.

If you have any unspent XP you start with an additional $5 \times unspent\ XP$ silver
