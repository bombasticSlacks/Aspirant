Characters will need to buy a reagent needed for a ritual, alchemical compound, mutagenic process or for some other crafting process. Reagents should be priced based on proximity to a source rather than just a flat rate. So, jungle flowers are easy to get in the jungle, not so in the desert.

### Bits
After killing a creature you can, unless it’s been annihilated, usually harvest some of what are called bits. Bits are a generalization of organs, glands, bones, and other valuables. Your character would intuitively know what parts of a creature are valuable even if you don’t yet, so monster harvests can just be logged as “wolf bits”, “golem bits”, “vampire bits”. Later, if you require the “heart of a golem” you could use a golem bit. This might end up causing oddities like a golem giving two bits and both being used as hearts; however, this should be hand waved away as splitting the heart or just not thinking about it too hard.

### Reagents Bag
A character who does a lot of ritual magic, or crafting, might get exhausted trying to maintain a large collection of bits. For such a character, they should get a Reagents Bag which helps to abstract out bits. [Example Gear](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pjotbn26OeQPVqfVwTOxSper5irKWGEU5Zs8rtsO9zI/edit#heading=h.d44f0cukbvb) has the details.

### Specificity
Unless the task you need a reagent for is exceptionally powerful, you should try to avoid specificity. Mutating a character to have cat-like eyes might require specifically eyes from a were-cat, but a potion of night sight should require the eyes of any nighttime predator.
