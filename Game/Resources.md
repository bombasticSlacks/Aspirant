### Reagents
Characters will need to buy a reagent needed for a ritual, alchemical compound, mutagenic process or for some other [Crafting](Crafting) process. Reagents should be priced based on proximity to a source rather than just a flat rate. So, jungle flowers are easy to get in the jungle, not so in the desert.

#### Bits
After killing a creature you can, unless it’s been annihilated, usually harvest some of what are called bits. Bits are a generalization of organs, glands, bones, and other valuables. Your character would intuitively know what parts of a creature are valuable even if you don’t yet, so monster harvests can just be logged as “wolf bits”, “golem bits”, “vampire bits”. Later, if you require the “heart of a golem” you could use a golem bit. This might end up causing oddities like a golem giving two bits and both being used as hearts; however, this should be hand waved away as splitting the heart or just not thinking about it too hard.

#### Flora
The world is full of powerful and magical materials for characters to scavenge. Some even grow in the ground. When you collect flora make note of the [Region](Telling-The-Story#Regions) it was collected in as some flora from locations have special properties [Reagent-Uses](Reagent-Uses).

#### Reagents Bag
A character who does a lot of ritual magic, [Crafting](Crafting), or [Science](Science) might get exhausted trying to maintain a large collection of bits. For such a character, they should get a [Reagent Bag](Example-Gear#Reagent%20Bag).

#### Specificity
Unless the task you need a reagent for is exceptionally powerful, you should try to avoid specificity. Mutating a character to have cat-like eyes might require specifically eyes from a were-cat, but a potion of night sight should require the eyes of any nighttime predator.

### Materials
All things are made up of basic materials. This usually isn't a major concern to the average adventurer, but a savvy tradesman will want to carefully select materials of varying qualities for their projects. Ratios are provided for materials, this is the amount that 1 size of the material would cost compared to 10 silver, or put another way, 1 size of silver. A [Example Materials](Example-Materials) list is provided.
