## Berserker
One of the 8 [combat training](Combat-Training) disciplines.

### Basic
#### Bushwhacker
Whenever someone misses an attack against you in melee, you may spend a reaction to make an attack with a hit location of the limb they attacked with.

#### Monstrous Leap
You calculate your movement distance based on strength instead of agility if you end your movement with a melee attack. 

#### Powerful Strike
You may opt to take a negative on an attack to get an equivalent bonus to damage up to +5.

#### Relentless Attack
When making an All Out Attack you get a +3 to damage for the turn.

### Advanced

#### Adrenaline Response
After taking an injury that would wound you, you immediately get to take a combat turn (in addition to your regular turn). After this free combat turn, you then roll resolve to resist long-term effects or avoid death as regular. 

#### Cleave
If you injure an enemy with a critical or lethal injury during an attack you may make an additional attack against another enemy in range with the same modifiers.

#### Enrage
When you make a [Melee](Melee) skill test, spend a [Power](Stats#Power) to become enraged. While enraged, you have: 
* +1 [Strength](Stats#Strength) 
* -1 [Intelligence](Stats#Intelligence)
* +2 to [Composure](Composure) tests
* Ignore [Being Wounded](Injury#Being%20Wounded)

On any turn where you don't make a melee skill test, you must roll a d6, on a 1-3 you stop being enraged.

#### Greater Cleave
If you have [Cleave](#Cleave) training, when making a charge you may target anyone with cleave who was in weapon range along the path.

#### Meat Shield
Your opponents have a 50% chance of hitting one of the other people in a melee combat when they attempt to fire ranged weapons into a melee you are a part of.

#### Thunderous Charge
Your charge attacks have the [Penetrating](Weapon-Traits#Penetrating) trait.

### Master
#### People’s Champion
