## Attacking
Usually, in combat, you will be trying to harm your opponents with the goal of killing or disabling them. Attacks will typically be:
* Thrown attacks using [Athletics](Strength#Athletics)
* Ranged attacks using [Accuracy](Agility#Accuracy)
* Melee attacks using [Strike](Strength#Strike) 
* Magic attacks using [Will](Spirit#Will)

### Attack Range
When you attack something, your range is how far you can engage them from. With melee weapons, you need to be within 2m. With Range, Thrown, and Magic you have a range, but it is possible to attack up to 5x your range, but you will suffer [Distance Penalty](#Distance%20Penalty). 
* Magic attacks have a range of 10m
* Thrown have a range of 3 times your [Strength](Strength)
* Ranged attacks will be defined in the weapons [traits](Weapons#[Weapon-Traits](Weapon-Traits)).

### Attacking
- Declare what weapon you are using
- Make sure you are within range (or figure out what your total penalty will be) 
- Determine any bonuses or negatives you have on the attack.
- Declare any modifiers you are applying to the attack.
- Roll a skill test. If you fail this test, the attack fails.
- If your attack doesn’t target a specific location, roll the hit location dice to determine where you hit.
- Your opponent can at this point attempt to avoid your attack if they would like to and have a reaction available. If they avoid, the attack fails.
- You compare the penetration value on your attack to the armour value of the limb you are trying to hit (this will be covered in depth later in this chapter). If you fail to penetrate, the attack fails.
- Roll a d6, add any relevant damage bonuses, and consult the damage chart for what corresponding injury they will take.

### Combat Bonuses and Negatives
These are common bonuses and negatives you can receive on your attacks which will make attacking easier. This is not an exhaustive list and sometimes if you feel you are advantaged over your opponent, you should express this to your GM, and they may give you additional bonuses. As well, some combat bonuses can be learned by taking specific combat training, or having specific pieces of equipment.
#### Charging
When making a melee attack or manoeuvre, if you have moved at least 3 meters towards your opponent you get a +1 to the skill test.
#### Shooting Position
If when shooting you are in a comfortable position you get a +1 to the skill test.
#### Outnumbered
If your opponent is outnumbered in melee, you receive a +1 to melee attacks and manoeuvres against them.
#### Severely Outnumbered
If your opponents are outnumbered in melee by more than 2 to 1 you receive a +2 to melee attacks and manoeuvres against them. (ex: 3 to 1, 5 to 2 etc.).
#### Unaware
When making an attack or manoeuvre, if your opponent is unaware of your presence, you get a +4 to the skill test.
#### On The Move
If you have moved this turn, you take a -2 to attacks and manoeuvres.
#### Unweighted for Throwing
If you attempt to throw a weapon that doesn’t have the thrown tag you receive a -3 on the skill test. Basic weapons only have a -1 penalty.
#### On Your Back
When attempting a melee test, if you are prone, you receive a -2.
#### Distance Penalty
When you fire a ranged weapon if you are outside the range, you suffer a -1 per range they are away from you.

> So if you have a range of 10m and are attacking 35 meters away, you suffer a -3.

### Combat Modifiers
These are modifiers you can apply to attacks and manoeuvres which will put you at a negative to the skill test but will make the attack or manoeuvre do additional things. Several other powerful modifiers can be learned by taking specific combat training. 
#### Called Shot
Your attack has a guaranteed hit location. -2 for arm or leg shots, -1 for chest shots, -3 for head shots.
#### Difficult Hit
You make your attacks harder to predict and therefore harder to avoid. You can give yourself a -1, -3 or -5 to your skill test to give your opponent a similar negative to any reactions.
#### Reposition
before making a melee attack or manoeuvre, you can move to a different side of your opponent. Puts the attack/manoeuvre at a -1.
