| Balanced              | 1    | +1 to defensive skill tests using this weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Black Powder          | 1    | Your weapon fires balls of lead propelled by incendiary powder. It no longer can be used as a melee weapon and is instead a ranged weapon with a range equal to 10m x size. You don’t add your STR to damage, but get an inherent +6 damage bonus. Reloading a black powder weapon takes 1 minute.                       |
| Bow                   | 2    | This weapon fires fletched arrows. It no longer can be used as a melee weapon and is instead a ranged weapon with a range equal to 10m x size. You can add STR to damage up to a maximum of the size of the weapon. Readying an arrow and firing a bow in the same turn gives a -1 to the marksmanship test.             |
| Crossbow              | 1    | Your weapon fires bolts of metal. It no longer can be used as a melee weapon and is instead a ranged weapon with a range equal to 10m x size. You don’t add your STR to damage, but get an inherent +3 damage bonus. After firing a crossbow, it takes a combat turn to reload.                                          |
| Deadly Draw           | 1    | This weapon is penetrative for your first attack in any combat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Fast Reloading        | 1    | If your weapon requires ammo, it can be reloaded in half the time. Reloads that normally take an action are instead free and any skill tests performed that turn are at a -2.                                                                                                                                            |
| Folding               | 2    | This weapon counts as two separate sizes. When stored, it is considered the smaller size.

| Momentum              | 1    | Whenever you attack with this weapon and don’t strike anything (either miss or the attack is dodged) your next attack gains +1 to hit and +1 to damage (up to three times).                                                                                                                                              |
| Multiple Damage Types | 1    | When you create this weapon, choose two damage types instead of one. When you attack, select one of the two types.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
