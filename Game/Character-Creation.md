## Character Creation
Before anything else try to imagine what your character should be. Are they a specific race? Tall? What color is their hair? Do they have any unique traits? These are the kinds of questions that will help fill out your character. None of this will have any bearing on your character's abilities but it could influence them.

### Character Creation Options
Your GM should discuss with your party to determine what sort of characters you want to create. There are a few seperate ways to create an aspirant character based on the power level and story you are looking to tell.

* [Humble-Beginnings](Humble-Beginnings) for if you want to start with very simple characters and explore / build the world together.
* [Adventurers](Adventurers) for if you want your characters to already be well traveled, with knowledge of the world around them.

Optionally characters may also begin with one (or more) [Cultural-Mutations](Cultural-Mutations) which can further effect starting XP.
