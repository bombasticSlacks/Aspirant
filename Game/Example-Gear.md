# Example [Gear](Core/Gear)

{: .no_toc }
This is a non-exhaustive list of the sort of gear your characters may need. If something isn't on this list work with your GM to come up with values for it, remember to [Obey Conservation Of Mass](Core/Terminology#Obey%20Conservation%20Of%20Mass).

- Cost is the expected cost to purchase from a merchant, commissioning also requires the commissioning fee from the tradesman.

## Clutter Items

Things character shouldn't be interested in buying to travel with but may be of use narratively should be treated as materials. 20ft of rope is equivalent to 2 size of cloth (based on quality), 10ft of chain is 2 size of metal, a steel cup is 1 size of metal, etc. these can be used in scenes but usually an adventurer is better suited using a properly packed kit of tools.
