# Activities

During [[Telling-The-Story#Downtime]], or [[Telling-The-Story#Travelling]] you will get a chance to do some activities. These are simple declarations of how you spend a large chunk of time, culminating in some benefit to the player.

## Downtime Activity

These are actions a character could spend a day doing. All characters have access to a number of these, others can be gained with [[Character-Development#Training]].

### Perform Travelling Activity

_Just because you are in a city doesn't mean you can't do the same things you do on the road!_

### Involved Task

_You've been busy working on something that isn't exactly a job._

When you do an involved task, you dedicate yourself to resolving something your character needs to deal with. At the end of the task you will either get to [[Telling-The-Story#Influencing the Story]] without a cost, gaining some tangible benefit, or asking the GM some direct questions. In all cases, there shouldn't be a skill test involved. Some example tasks would be.

- Hiring a specific expert to aid on a job.
- Researching a specific topic in depth.
- Finding a really specific rare item.

## Working a Job

Jobs are ways to spend days and supplement your income. They come in 3 variants.

### Day Work

- Depending on the settlement, any area will have specific types of labour available. These will be associated with each of the 5 [[Attributes]].
- You earn silver equal to your [[Attributes]] value associated with the work.

> If a character was in a lumber and trapping settlement, they may have physical labour (strength) available as well as tracking labour (agility). A character could choose to do physical labour, making their strength value in silver.

### Skilled Work

_Your character has a specific skill or talent that they are trained to leverage._

- You can make the amount of silver that a [[Services|Service]], normally costs, that your character is capable of performing.
- This will require succeeding at an appropriate skill test. With failure resulting in 0 silver.

### Production Work

Your character has a specific skill or talent and can create a certain amount of goods ready to be traded based on succeeding on a skill test of some kind. Similar to Skilled work, but your compensation will usually not be in silver, and instead in something that will need to be exchanged.

Any production work you do, assuming you succeed, will pay similarly to what it costs in [[Services#Costs Of Services]]. When you arrive in a town for the first time every week, the town should perform a [[Skills#Variable Difficulty]] [[Running-The-Game#Wealth]] test to determine how many people in town want production work done. If the town succeeds, 1 job + 1 per [[Skills#Step Of Success]] is available.

The GM may put limits on what sorts of work the locals want done, but shouldn't be too conservative. Even a small, poor village might put their money together to get a powerful ritualist to make sure they have rain in the coming weeks.
