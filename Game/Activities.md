## Activities
When [Resting](Telling-The-Story#Resting), or [Travelling](Telling-The-Story#Travelling) you will get a chance to do some activities. These are simple declarations of how you spend a large chunk of time, culminating in some benefit to the player.


### Downtime Activity
These are actions a character could spend a day doing. All characters have access to a number of these, others can be gained with [Training](Character-Development#Training).
#### Perform Evening Activity

#### Injury Recovery
#### Interview

#### Supervised Training

#### Surgery

#### Work
Performing an activity or job to make currency. Usually requires some training. Basic labour work pays 1 silver per day.

### Evening Activity
These are actions that a character could do to wind down in the evening before preparing for the next leg of a journey, or before arriving somewhere important. All characters have access to a number of these, others can be gained with [Training](Character-Development#Training).
#### Good Nights Rest
+1 to a single skill test the next day, declared before rolling.
#### Half Work
Do half the work required for a type of Production Work. If this is the second half of the job, roll the required skill tests and check the outcome of the job.
#### Meditate
Refresh your [Power](Stats#Power) to maximum.
#### On Watch
Dedicate yourself to the night watch, you receive a +3 on any [Perception](Perception) tests against [Ambush Encounters](#Ambush%20Encounter) and are not surprised if ambushed. 
#### Socialize
Any number of the characters in the party may socialize. Any time you aid a character you socialized with, they get a +2 instead of a +1. Socializing while in a city costs 1 silver per person. Socializing while [Travelling](#Travelling), requires an activity such as a [Games Kit](Example-Gear#Games%20Kit).
#### Unsupervised Training
Spending 1XP on character progression where you donâ€™t need someone to train you (either from a book or a training you have already started).  

### Working a Job
Jobs are ways to spend days and supplement your income. They come in 3 variants.

#### Day Work
Your character works the day at an up front rate. This work is typically for a company or group that exists in the town and needs labourers. Almost all locations should provide a basic labourer position at 1 silver per day.

#### Skilled Work
Your character has a specific skill or talent that they are trained to leverage. Usually, how this works is your character will be compensated a variable amount based on how successful you are at a skill test.

#### Production Work
Your character has a specific skill or talent and can create a certain amount of readily sellable goods based on succeeding on a skill test of some kind. Similar to Skilled work, but your compensation will usually not be in silver, and instead in something that will need to be exchanged.

Any production work you do, assuming you succeed, will pay similarly to what it costs in [Costs Of Services](Services#Costs%20Of%20Services). When you arrive in a town for the first time every week, the town should perform a [Variable Difficulty](Skills#Variable%20Difficulty) [Wealth](Running-The-Game#Wealth) test to determine how many people in town want production work done. If the town succeeds, 1 job + 1 per [Step Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success) is available. 

The GM may put limits on what sorts of work the locals want done, but shouldn't be too conservative. Even a small, poor village might put their money together to get a powerful ritualist to make sure they have rain in the coming weeks.
