## Activities
When [Resting](Telling-The-Story#Resting), or [Travelling](Telling-The-Story#Travelling) you will get a chance to do some activities. These are simple declarations of how you spend a large chunk of time, culminating in some benefit to the player.

#### Work

### Travel Activity
These are actions that a character can do while travelling somewhere, your spare time in the evenings or additional brain power on the road are dedicated to whatever you do. All characters have access to a number of these, others can be gained with [Training](Character-Development#Training).
#### Good Night's Rest
*You focus on sleeping and being prepared for what lies ahead*
* +1 to a single skill test the next day, declared before rolling.
* Refresh your [Power](Stats#Power) to maximum.

#### Do Production Work
*You tinker and work away in the evenings, maybe even while riding*
Do everything required for some Production Work.
#### On Watch
*You organize watch for the team taking extra shifts when necessary*
* When the GM rolls to determine if an [Ambush Encounter](Telling-The-Story#Ambush%20Encounter) occurs, you may have your [Subterfuge](Subterfuge) provide a penalty to the roll. 
* You receive a +3 on any [Perception](Perception) tests during [Ambush Encounter](Telling-The-Story#Ambush%20Encounter).
* You are not surprised if ambushed. 
* You regain 1 [Power](Stats#Power)

#### Scavenge
*You hunt, forage, and provide for the group*

#### Scout

* When your GM rolls to see if you have a [Travel Encounter](Telling-The-Story#Travel%20Encounter) you may have your [Subterfuge](Subterfuge) provide a penalty to the roll. 
* The [GM](How-To-Play#GM) will describe any [Travel Encounter](Telling-The-Story#Travel%20Encounter) that occurs to you, before the scene begins. 
* You also gain 1 [Influencing the Story](Telling-The-Story#Influencing%20the%20Story)

#### Socialize
*Your character work on getting closer together, sharing moments*
Any number of the characters in the party may socialize. Any time you aid a character you socialized with, they get a +2 instead of a +1. Socializing while [Travelling](#Travelling), requires an activity such as a [Games Kit](Example-Gear#Games%20Kit), or good food.
#### Night Training
Spending up to 2XP on character progression where you donâ€™t need someone to train you (either from a book or a training you have already started) or the person is in camp with you.  

### Working a Job
Jobs are ways to spend days and supplement your income. They come in 3 variants.

#### Day Work
Your character works the day at an up front rate. This work is typically for a company or group that exists in the town and needs labourers. Almost all locations should provide a basic labourer position at 1 silver per day.

#### Skilled Work
Your character has a specific skill or talent that they are trained to leverage. Usually, how this works is your character will be compensated a variable amount based on how successful you are at a skill test.

#### Production Work
Your character has a specific skill or talent and can create a certain amount of goods ready to be traded based on succeeding on a skill test of some kind. Similar to Skilled work, but your compensation will usually not be in silver, and instead in something that will need to be exchanged.

Any production work you do, assuming you succeed, will pay similarly to what it costs in [Costs Of Services](Services#Costs%20Of%20Services). When you arrive in a town for the first time every week, the town should perform a [Variable Difficulty](Skills#Variable%20Difficulty) [Wealth](Running-The-Game#Wealth) test to determine how many people in town want production work done. If the town succeeds, 1 job + 1 per [Step Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success) is available. 

The GM may put limits on what sorts of work the locals want done, but shouldn't be too conservative. Even a small, poor village might put their money together to get a powerful ritualist to make sure they have rain in the coming weeks.
