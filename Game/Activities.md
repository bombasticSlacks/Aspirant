## Working a Job

Jobs are ways to spend days and supplement your income. They come in 3 variants.

### Day Work

- Depending on the settlement, any area will have specific types of labour available. These will be associated with each of the 5 [Attributes](Core/Attributes).
- You earn silver equal to your [Attributes](Core/Attributes) value associated with the work.

> If a character was in a lumber and trapping settlement, they may have physical labour (strength) available as well as tracking labour (agility). A character could choose to do physical labour, making their strength value in silver.

### Skilled Work

_Your character has a specific skill or talent that they are trained to leverage._

- You can make the amount of silver that a [Service](Services), normally costs, that your character is capable of performing.
- This will require succeeding at an appropriate skill test. With failure resulting in 0 silver.

### Production Work

Your character has a specific skill or talent and can create a certain amount of goods ready to be traded based on succeeding on a skill test of some kind. Similar to Skilled work, but your compensation will usually not be in silver, and instead in something that will need to be exchanged.

Any production work you do, assuming you succeed, will pay similarly to what it costs in [Costs Of Services](Services#Costs%20Of%20Services). When you arrive in a town for the first time every week, the town should perform a [Variable Difficulty](Core/Skills#Variable%20Difficulty) [Wealth](Core/Running-The-Game#Wealth) test to determine how many people in town want production work done. If the town succeeds, 1 job + 1 per [Step Of Success](Core/Skills#Step%20Of%20Success) is available.

The GM may put limits on what sorts of work the locals want done, but shouldn't be too conservative. Even a small, poor village might put their money together to get a powerful ritualist to make sure they have rain in the coming weeks.
