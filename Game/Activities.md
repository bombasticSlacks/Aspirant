# Activities

During [[Telling-The-Story#Downtime]], or [[Travelling]] you will get a chance to do some activities. These are simple declarations of how you spend a large chunk of time, culminating in some benefit to the player.

## Downtime Activity

These are actions a character could spend a day doing. All characters have access to a number of these, others can be gained with [[Character-Development#Training]].

---
### Perform A Lengthy Action

_You dedicate yourself to a task you deem important_

Perform an [[Terminology#Action]] or series of [[Terminology#Action]] to accomplish a goal such as building something.

---

### Involved Task

_You've been busy working on something that isn't exactly a job._

When you do an involved task, you dedicate yourself to resolving something your character needs to deal with. At the end of the task you will either gain some tangible benefit, or ask the GM some direct questions. In all cases, there shouldn't be a skill test involved. Some example tasks would be.

- Hiring a specific expert to aid on a job.
- Researching a specific topic in depth.
- Finding a really specific rare item.

---

### Join A Guild

_You gain the fundamentals of a [[Character-Development#Concept]] or [[Character-Development#Discipline]] by joining the respective school._

- You can now learn training from that [[Character-Development#Discipline]] or [[Character-Development#Concept]].
- You may then gain the [[Character-Development#Introduction]] if you have the experience.
- For pricing, see [[Services#Teaching]].

---
### Work

_You use your abilities to work a job and keep busy._

Based on your location the locals will need things done and be happy for assistance. The [[Terminology#Game Master]] will provide a list of relevant spots to work, but if you have an idea what you would like to do you may suggest one. 

This work will require a skill of some kind. You cannot work if you are [[Skills#Untrained]] in the skill. At the end of the week you gain money based on the following:


| Skill             | 3-4 | 5-6 | 7   |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base Compensation | 2   | 3   | 4   |

Further you gain +2 silver if you are a member of a relevant guild.

### Call On The City

_You are interested in what this city has to offer. You busy yourself learning its workings and what is going on._

- You may ask the GM a direct question about the place you are.
  Then you may do one of the following:
- Ask the GM another question about the city.
- Invent something about the city.
- Gain an [[Terminology#Ally]] for the duration of your stay. Work with the GM to determine who this is (potentially costing influence).

### Hone Your Skills

### Good Night's Rest

### Reinforcement Learning
