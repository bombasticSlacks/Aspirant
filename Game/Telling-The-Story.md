# Telling The Story

Gameplay in Aspirant is generally split into a few different types of gameplay: Combat, Narrative Time, Travelling, Resting.

## Combat

Combat is the most rigorously kept time in Aspirant; as it is when you are most likely to be injured and die. Combat is covered in more detail [[Combat|here]], but in general, characters take turns acting in 5 second increments.

## Narrative Time

Narrative time in aspirant involves characters in a place of interest doing activities, exploring, and progressing the story directly. The passage of narrative time can be a bit more ambiguous compared with combat. There aren’t rules for narrative time, this is when characters will be directing the focus and the story themselves.

## Flashback

Sometimes an ability or necessity will require you to explore a scene that happened in the past. If this occurs it is similar to [[#Narrative Time|Narrative Time]] with the following additional rules.
* Nothing can occur that would contradict the present. 
* The [[Terminology#Game Master]] gets the final say on if a [[Terminology#Player Character]] behavior is appropriate. 

Dealing with non-linear time can be complicated and everyone should attempt to behave in good faith. 

## Downtime

This tends to happen when you are in a safe area. When in a friendly settlement with no impending danger your characters can choose to take 5 days and rest focusing on yourselves, your work, and resting up. While doing downtime each character:

* Gain the benefits of [[#Recovery]].
* Consider your [[Strain-And-Toil#Needs]] met.
- Performs 1 [[Activities#Downtime Activity]].
* Pay for [[#Lodgings|Lodgings]].
- While performing downtime, players should be encouraged to still take part in scenes in [[#Narrative Time|Narrative Time]], maybe they meet local artisans, haggle with a shopkeeper, or find the start of an adventure. Time shouldn't exclusively be occupied with a [[Activities#Downtime Activity]], but it will help explain what you are doing when not otherwise occupied.

### Recovery
- Reset [[Stress]] to 0.
- Reset uses of all Once Per Downtime abilities.


### Lodgings
Each settlement will have a cost for 5 days of lodgings, usually it will be 2 silver which will cover your food and housing for the duration.
## Travelling

Travelling in Aspirant can take long amounts of time. Travelling involves knowing the direction or location of something and then travelling towards it. Travel will usually take a number of days. To travel you require at minimum [[Camping-Gear]].

### Travel Segment

For simplicity, travel is:

- Simply, the time to get from one location to another
- Most travel should focus on hitting a milestone of some kind at least within 5 days. Travel should be directed to get somewhere. Unstructured travel isn't travel, it is adventuring.
- A full day of travel is considered 14 hours of continual travel, this gives the characters ample time to rest.
- Characters need to manage their [[Strain-And-Toil#Needs]].
- Characters at the start of each travel segment declare a [[Activities#Travel Activity]] they will focus on during the travel.
- A travel segment will have a [[#Segment Danger]].
- A travel segment will have a [[#Segment Time]].
- A travel segment may have [[#Segment Modifiers]].
- Characters will experience a [[#Night Encounter]].
- Characters will experience a [[#Route Encounter]].

#### Night Encounter
During their time camping something eventful will happen to the players. It can be as simple as a description of the night sky, fireflies out, or a companion telling a story from their childhood. 

This encounter depending on [[#Segment Danger]] might be dangerous instead.

#### Route Encounter
During their time traveling something eventful will happen to the players. It can be as simple as a description of the local flowers, a passing caravan saying hello, or a shift in the weather. More involved events such as encountering other travellers, enemies or a point of interest could occur.

This encounter depending on [[#Segment Danger]] might be dangerous instead.

Players should only experience 1 route encounter per travel segment. If your players were attacked by wolves a number of times travelling through a forest, instead, that should be handled as one extended narrative / combat [[Terminology#Scene]] where they realize they’ve entered dangerous territory and need to navigate out of it.

#### Segment Time
In Aspirant movement between places should be measured in time, not distance. So a place might be a days travel, or 4 days travel, from where you are. 

#### Segment Danger
Each route will have a rating between 1-6 for danger. When traveling it the GM should secretly roll for 2 6 sided dice to see what sorts of events the characters will experience. For each dice that comes up with at least the danger rating the players experience a dangerous encounter. This can either be their [[#Night Encounter]] or [[#Route Encounter]], or, if both dice roll dangerous both encounters will be dangerous.

> A route has a danger rating of 3. The GM secretly rolls a 2 and a 4, they decide the players will have a dangerous night encounter and a normal route encounter. 

#### Segment Modifiers
Some travel segments will have specific modifiers. 
* Maybe its dangerously hot, cold, you can get sick. 
* Some travel segments will restrict types of [[Asset]], no [[Asset#Vehicles]], no horses, etc.
* Maybe no [[Activities#Travel Activity]] can be performed. 

### Travel Speed
Some [[Asset]] or abilities may increase the travel speed of characters. Humans have a travel speed of 1x, a traveling groups speed is equal to the lowest speed among them.

## Creating New Content

If a player has an idea for something their character wants to do that should require training but isn’t covered in the rules, then if reasonable, you should let them perform it! Usually, since it is without training, there will be a large associated negative, but at that point work on making a [[Game/Character-Development#Concept]] that is appropriate. They don’t need an expert or school to start the training, their character invented it!
