## Telling The Story
Gameplay in Aspirant is generally split into a few different types of gameplay: Combat, Narrative Time, Travelling, Resting.

### Combat
Combat is the most rigorously kept time in Aspirant; as it is when you are most likely to be injured and die. Combat is covered in more detail [here](Combat), but in general, characters take turns acting in 5 second increments. 

### Narrative Time
Narrative time in aspirant involves characters in a place of interest doing activities, exploring, and progressing the story directly. The passage of narrative time can be a bit more ambiguous compared with combat. There aren’t rules for narrative time, this is when characters will be directing the focus and the story themselves.

### Travelling
Travelling in Aspirant can take long amounts of time. Travelling at its simplest level involves knowing the direction or location of something and then travelling towards it. Travel will usually take a number of days. 

#### Travel Segment
For simplicity travel is split into:
* 5 day segments:
* Or a partial segment on arriving at a destination:

At the end of each segment:
- characters will need to pay for the food they used (rations tend to cost 1 silver/day)
- horses will in most situations be able to feed themselves but otherwise also need 1 silver worth of food per day
- A full day of travel is considered 8 hours of continual travel, this gives the horses and characters ample time to rest
- Characters at the end of each travel segment get to perform an [Evening Activity](#Evening%20Activity).

#### Travel Encounter
During travel, characters may encounter other travellers, enemies or a point of interest. These will be handled by the GM and should lend to the danger and intrigue of the surrounding world. Generally, the world is sparse and most characters should only have 1 travel encounter per [Travel Segment](#Travel%20Segment), though in very dense or dangerous areas the GM can roll for more. If your players were attacked by wolves a number of times travelling through a forest instead, that should be handled as one extended narrative / combat scene where they realize they’ve entered dangerous territory and need to navigate out of it.

#### Ambush Encounter
Similarly, during travel the party may be ambushed while camping. These should be high stakes encounters that put the players in danger. Generally danger isn't lurking around every corner and the characters should only have 1 ambush encounter per [Travel Segment](#Travel%20Segment).

### Evening Activity
These are actions that a character could do to wind down in the evening before preparing for the next leg of a journey, or before arriving somewhere important. All characters have access to a number of these, others can be gained with [Training](Character-Development#Training).
#### Good Nights Rest
+1 to a single skill test the next day, declared before rolling.
#### Half Work
Do half the work required for a type of Production Work. If this is the second half of the job, roll the required skill tests and check the outcome of the job.
#### Meditate
Refresh your [Power](Stats#Power) to maximum.
#### On Watch
Dedicate yourself to the night watch, you receive a +3 on any [Perception](Perception) tests against [Ambush Encounters](#Ambush%20Encounter) and are not surprised if ambushed. 
#### Socialize
Any number of the characters in the party may socialize. Any time you aid a character you socialized with, they get a +2 instead of a +1. Socializing while in a city costs 1 silver per person. Socializing while [Travelling](#Travelling), requires an activity such as a [Games Kit](Example-Gear#Games%20Kit).
#### Unsupervised Training
Spending 1XP on character progression where you don’t need someone to train you (either from a book or a training you have already started).  

---

### Resting
Resting is fast forwarded downtime your characters will sometimes have. This tends to happen when you arrive in a safe area. Each day in a safe area, your character may perform 1 [Downtime Activities](#Downtime%20Activity). Unless you are receiving charity, your food, and housing costs 1 silver per day. If you cannot afford this, you do not get to do activities. On the last day of resting before departure, everyone in the party also gets to perform an [Evening Activity](#Evening%20Activity).

### Downtime Activity
These are actions a character could spend a day doing. All characters have access to a number of these, others can be gained with [Training](Character-Development#Training).
#### Perform Evening Activity
Perform an [Evening Activity](#Evening%20Activity)
#### Injury Recovery
#### Interview
Hiring a specific expert to aid on a job.
#### Research

#### Source
Searching for a specific item to buy.
#### Supervised Training
Spending 1XP on character progression, where someone else needs to train you (covered in Character Development).
#### Surgery
Undergoing Surgery.
#### Work
Performing an activity or job to make currency. Usually requires some training. Basic labour work pays 1 silver per day.

### Working a Job
Jobs are ways to spend days and supplement your income. They come in 3 variants.

#### Day Work
Your character works the day at an up front rate. This work is typically for a company or group that exists in the town and needs labourers. Almost all locations should provide a basic labourer position at 1 silver per day.

#### Skilled Work
Your character has a specific skill or talent that they are trained to leverage. Usually, how this works is your character will be compensated a variable amount based on how successful you are at a skill test.

#### Production Work
Your character has a specific skill or talent and can create a certain amount of readily sellable goods based on succeeding on a skill test of some kind. Similar to Skilled work, but your compensation will usually not be in silver, and instead in something that will need to be exchanged.

### Influencing the Story
Aspirant should be a shared experience. So when you play the GM may ask you for suggestions or to volunteer ideas such as: “what is this town known for?”, “someone give me a cool female name.”. When these are accepted by the GM you receive 1 influence which you can spend to influence the game world in any way the GM allows. When you want to influence the world:
- You will ask the GM, “Can this thing be the case?” 
- The GM will deliberate and assign an influence cost required “For it to be so you will need to spend X influence.”  
- Then you and any players who want to contribute can spend the required influence to make this happen.
- If you don’t have the influence, feel free to try to negotiate for something similarly useful to your character or of interest.

So as an example, if you wanted to train a specific duellist training you could have this conversation:

```
Player 1: “What if there is a travelling master swordsman moving through this town?” 

GM: “hmm that isn’t too far-fetched I’ll allow a master duellist to be travelling through for 4 influence, or how about it’s a journeyman, but they know the training you want for 2 influence?”

Player 2: “I’ll pitch in the extra 2 influences for the master! Maybe we can hire them to help with our next job!”

Player 1: “Sure sounds good.”

GM: “Great, spend 2 influence each, now tell me more about this swordsman. What is their name? What are they doing here?” 
```

Remember, as a GM this system is designed to get your players involved in building the world. Costs aren’t provided here since different GMs will ask their players more or less for help building the world, but some opportunity to shape it should be provided.

### Creating New Content
If a player has an idea for something their character wants to do that should require training but isn’t covered in the book, then if reasonable you should let them perform it! Usually, since it is without training, there will be a large associated negative, but at that point work on making a training of an appropriate tier and let them immediately put, if available, 1XP towards it. They don’t need an expert or manual to start the training, their character invented it!
