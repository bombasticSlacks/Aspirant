## Lore
In Aspirant, you take the role of characters that aspire to something greater. Whether it be to become a great merchant, wizard, politician, or warrior, you all desire to be something greater than what you came from. The world of aspirant will start out small, without much known to the players, but as they adventure they will find a world of intrigue and magic to discover.

As a group, players and the GM should explore what exists and what doesn’t. Is magic a big part of people's lives? Are monsters prevalent? Do other fantasy races exist? Do they live in integrated villages and cities? What other technology exists? What Gods or otherworldly powers influence this world? These questions will all be answered as you play.
