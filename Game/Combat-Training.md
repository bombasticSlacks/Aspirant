#TODOoverloaded
When using a weapon of size 4 or greater you may Sweep, Hold, Strike True

Sweep – As a special manoeuvre, you may make a melee skill test. If successful, all enemies in melee with you and within 3m of you need to dodge or be knocked prone.

Hold – A special manoeuvre similar to parry, however if an enemy moves and then attacks you they receive a -2 on their attack.

Strike True - If an enemy is prone, and you make a melee attack against them, you receive a +4 to hit, and you add 3 to your damage roll.

#### Iaido
#TODOoverloaded
When using a one handed weapon with a sheath, you can Quick Draw, Sheath Block, and Reenter Stance.

Quick Draw – If your weapon is sheathed, you can make an attack with +2 bonus to hit. When rolling damage, roll an extra d6 and take the highest roll.

Sheath Block - You can parry and block while your weapon is sheathed.

Reenter Stance – At the end of any attack or manoeuvre, other than quick draw, you may end it by sheathing your Iaido weapon.

#### Master Of Arms
You can declare a weapon you are using has an additional trait worth up to 2 trait points. It has that trait for the rest of an encounter. Using this ability costs [Power](Stats#Power) equal to the trait value. If this is used additional times in a single encounter only the most recently declared Master Of Arms trait counts. 

#### Constant Movement
You can perform reactions during your own turn.
