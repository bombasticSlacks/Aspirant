### Successful Attack

### Non-mitigated Attack

### Combat Round
In combat, a combat round is all the actions of every [Character](#Character) in that combat. When everyone has taken a combat turn, the combat round is over and a new combat round starts.

### Combat Turn

What they are doing is happening in parallel with everyone else, but for simplicity the game takes things in an order determined by initiative.
