## Terminology

This page consists of all terms and keywords a player may come into contact with while playing the game.

### Attack
Any skill test where a [Character](#Character) is attempting to harm or disrupt another. 
### Successful Attack
If a [Character](#Character) succeeds on an [Attack](#Attack) skill test, that is considered a Successful Attack

### Non-mitigated Attack
If a [Character](#Character) succeeds on an [Attack](#Attack) skill test and their [Opponent](#Opponent) doesn't stop the attack with a [Reaction](#Reaction), that is a non-mitigated attack.

### Mitigated Attack
If a [Character](#Character) fails an attack roll or their [Opponent](#Opponent) stops the attack with a reaction, that is a mitigated attack.

### Injuring Attack
If a [Character](#Character) successfully causes an injury with an attack, that is an Injuring Attack.

### Reaction
A response a [Character](#Character) can perform in combat while it is not their turn. [Characters](#Character) generally get 1 reaction per [Combat Round](#Combat%20Round). A [Character's](#Character) reaction refreshes at the start of their [Combat Turn](#Combat%20Turn).

### Combat Round
In combat, a combat round is all the actions of every [Character](#Character) in that combat. When everyone has taken a combat turn, the combat round is over and a new combat round starts. If it is important for some reason, a combat round usually encompasses 5 seconds of time, but shouldn't be dwelled on too specifically unless necessary.

### Combat Turn
In combat, a turn is a [Character's](#Character) portion of the round. What they are doing is happening in parallel with everyone else, but for simplicity the game takes things in an order determined by initiative. On a character's turn, they can usually do one action and potentially move. See [Your Turn](Combat#Your%20Turn) for more details on what a character can do.

### Opponent
The opposition of a skill test. The character who will be negatively effected by the outcome.

### In Melee
A character is considered in melee if they are actively fighting another character with a weapon that does not have a specified range. Generally, this means they are within 2 meters of an [Opponent](#Opponent) and the [Character](#Character) has either attacked or been attacked. See [Being in Melee Combat](Combat#Being%20in%20Melee%20Combat) for more details.

### Character
References a player character, NPC, creature, or other entity that might perform an action, or have an action performed on them.

### Melee Attack
An [Attack](#Attack) with a weapon with no otherwise specified range that is not thrown. You can generally make a melee attack within 2m of your opponent.

### Thrown Attack

### Trained

### Follower

### Ranged Attack
