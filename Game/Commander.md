### Basic

#### Blessed
#TODORedundant 
You no longer automatically fail skill tests on a roll of 2. 

When performing a re-roll for any reason, you may add 2 to the result.

#### Conscription
At the beginning of combat, you may opt to make neutral characters within FEL x 10m followers. They may become angry if put in suicidal situations.

#### Faithful
You receive a +1 to all skill tests against anyone who shares similar beliefs to your character.

#### Forced March
When travelling, you and your allies require half the food, this means everyone will pay every second day.

#### Heretic
FEL times per meditation, you may designate a target as a heretic/enemy of the cause. They receive a -1 to all skill tests that they make. Any skill tests allies make against that character receive a +1.

#### Inspiring Presence
If you have [With Me](#With%20Me) training, you can control an additional 2 followers.

#### Inspiring Strike
After succeeding on a melee skill test, all your allies receive a +1 to all attack rolls until your next turn.

#### Lookout Sir
If you have [With Me](#With%20Me) training, when attacked, if a follower under your control is within 3m they may expend their reaction to move to your character and become the target of the attack. They may still perform a block reaction if they can.

#### Sanctuary
During rest, if you are somewhere that shares your faith or believes in your cause, you do not need to spend currency per day to live.

#### With Me
You can control followers in combat. You can control a number of followers equal to your FEL - 2 (minimum of 0).

---
### Advanced

#### Grand Leadership
As an action, you can perform a speech in combat. All your followers roll all combat skill tests, substituting your FEL + Converse for their normal roll until your next action.

#### Holy Spirit
Your character is partially controlled by another force, which helps you out with multitasking. You have an additional reaction you can use to avoid attacks or anything else a reaction is used for. As well, if you are stunned or knocked unconscious, you may opt to continue fighting or acting with the spirit controlling your body. You count as having 2 in each attribute and 1 in each skill while the force is in control or performing a reaction.

#### Inspiring Shout
Once per meditation, you may as a free action cause one of your allies to regain consciousness. This ally retains all injuries and effects, but if it is during combat, does not need to roll to remain conscious until injured again.

#### Unending Fury
#TODOmaster
You and your followers never collapse from injuries. Other allies get a +2 to heroism.
