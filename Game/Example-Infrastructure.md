### Workshop
A fully furnished shop for some sort of expert. Select a specialization from the [Tool Set](Example-Gear#Tool%20Set) list, this workshop counts as that toolkit, any skill tests related to that tool kit gain a +2. 

Costs 150 silver, you can add a second kit for an additional 100 silver.

Renting this facility for other experts to use returns 2 silver per day.


### Cart
A way to move large ammounts of items and people around the countryside with ease. A cart can be used to travel if:
* At least 2 horses are hooked up to haul it (though more can be).
* 2 people spend their day driving.
* You are not taking it off a standard trail.

The benefit of traveling with a cart is that it: 
* Holds 60 size worth of items with people counting as 10 size.
* Any person not driving gets a [Downtime Activity](Telling-The-Story#Downtime%20Activity) every day of travel.
* Moves at the same rate as traveling by horse.

A cart can further be upgraded:
#### Coach
For 100 silver your cart is fully enclosed, giving privacy, and protection from the elements.
#### Extra Storage
For 50 silver you gain an additional 10 storage, this can be taken 6 times.
#### Workspace
For 150 silver you gain 1 space worth of land to install other infrastructure.
