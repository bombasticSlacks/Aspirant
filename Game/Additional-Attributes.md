# Additional Attributes
{: .no_toc }

On top of the above attributes, your character also has a few additional values:
### Power
A stat tracking how many times your character can perform certain powerful abilities. Some [Training](Character-Development#Training) will require you to expend this resource. It can be regained using the [Good Night's Rest](Activities#Good%20Night's%20Rest) [Travel Activity](Activities#Travel%20Activity).

Your Maximum Power is equal to [Intelligence](Intelligence) + 1 per [Training](Character-Development#Training) that requires power.

### Total XP
An abstraction of your characters' potential to learn and gain new abilities. [Character-Development](Character-Development) has details on how to spend this.

### Spent XP
Aspirants will not immediately spend experience as they gain it, expertise comes from the knowledge of others, so your spent XP should be tracked separately from your total.

### Affinity
The number of magic items you can [Bind](Magic-Items#Binding).

Affinity is equal to your [Spirit](Spirit).

### Influence
A measure of the influence you as a player have over the story. See [Influencing the Story](Telling-The-Story#Influencing%20the%20Story) for more details.

You start with [Communication](Communication) influence, and can have a maximum influence equal to [Communication](Communication).
