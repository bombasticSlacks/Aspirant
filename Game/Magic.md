## Magic
Magic in aspirant is free flowing and should be created during the scene. Certain trainings will explain broadly the sort of effects a magic wielder can perform, but there is no explicit spell list. Generally, magic comes in two broad categories:

### Channelled Magic
which is performed on the spot and manipulates the world using [Resonant](Resonant) material to cause temporary changes. Its effects should be instant and related to the moment in which it happens.

Channelling magic is a [Will](Spirit#Will) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty) skill test with a difficulty based on circumstances. 

Channelled Magic requires:
* A [Focus](Example-Gear#Focus).
* [Resonant](Resonant) [Materials](Materials) to power it.
* Training in [Will](Spirit#Will).
* Additional training to do more than simple parlour tricks.

#### Magical Energy
Channelled magic requires magical energy. Focused magic that can be expended to temporarily shape the world around you. [Resonant](Resonant) material has inherent magical energy based on its quality. A [Focus](Example-Gear#Focus) can be used to convert this magical energy into effects.

### Concentration
You can only maintain one instance of channelled magic at a time. You can still perform instantaneous magic while concentrating. 

For every hour you are concentrating on a magical effect you need to perform a [Will](Spirit#Will) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(0) skill test, if you fail, the magical effect ends.

#### Examples
* Throwing a fireball.
* Creating a cloud of smoke.
* Disrupting a troll's magic healing. 
## Ritual Magic
Which is performed using advanced rituals, rites, and performances along with specific materials to permanently change the world or perceive the flow of magic itself. 

Ritual magic is a [Attunement](Spirit#Attunement) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty) skill test with a difficulty based on circumstances. 

Ritual Magic requires:
* A [Reagent Bag](Example-Gear#Reagent%20Bag).
* Additional [Materials](Materials).
* Training in [Attunement](Spirit#Attunement).
* Additional training to do more than follow a ritual from a manual or book.

### Examples
