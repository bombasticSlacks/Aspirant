# Magic

Magic in aspirant is free flowing and should be created during the [[Terminology#Scene]]. Certain trainings will explain broadly the sort of effects a magic wielder can perform, but there is no explicit spell list. Generally, magic comes in two broad categories:

## Channelled Magic

Which is performed on the spot and manipulates the world using [[#Magical Energy|Magical Energy]] to cause temporary changes. Its effects should be instant and related to the moment in which it happens. Channeled magic cannot cause permanent changes (unless its indirect). 

Channelling magic is a [[Instinct#Ascendancy]] [[Skills#Fixed Difficulty]] skill test with a difficulty based on circumstances.

Channelled Magic requires:

- [[#Magical Energy|Magical Energy]] such as from a [[Focus]].
- To be taught a spell, or trained to create your own.

### Magical Energy

Channelled magic requires magical energy. Focused magic that can be expended to temporarily shape the world around you. Usually magical energy will be stored in an object which you can use to perform magic.

### Concentration

You can only maintain one instance of channelled magic at a time. You can still perform instantaneous magic while concentrating.

Whenever a [[Terminology#Scene]] ends, or narratively appropriate as you are put under stress you will need to make an additional [[Instinct#Ascendancy]] [[Skills#Fixed Difficulty]] to maintain concentration. [[Terminology#Damage]] shouldn't cause this to occur, but [[Injury]] might.

### Examples

- Throwing a fireball.
- Creating a cloud of smoke.
- Disrupting a troll's magic healing.

## Ritual Magic

Which is performed using advanced rituals, rites, and performances along with specific materials to permanently change the world or perceive the flow of magic itself.

Ritual magic is an [[Instinct#Ascendancy]] [[Skills#Fixed Difficulty]] skill test with a difficulty based on circumstances.

Ritual Magic requires:

- A [[Reagent-Bag]].
- Additional [[Materials]].
- Time, a ritual should never be instantaneous.
- A reference manual, or instructions on how to perform the ritual.

## Examples

- Peering into the future or past.
- Summoning an elemental from another dimension.
- Resurrecting the dead.
