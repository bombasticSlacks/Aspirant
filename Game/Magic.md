## Magic
Characters with the skills of channel or ritual and some training in magical disciplines can perform powerful feats of magic.

### Restrictions
Unlike with most skills, magic is a complex field. There is a limit on what difficulty spell you can attempt to cast based on discipline and training. So, a character with channeller training and basic Abjuration can at most attempt amateur abjuration spells, anything above that would be impossible. A magic skill when under pressure has a related skill test penalty. When under pressure, amateur spells have a 0, expert spells have a -1, master level spells have a -2.

### Disciplines
There are 8 generally used magical disciplines (however, there are plenty of other less explored disciplines). Below each discipline basics are explained as well as examples of what you can do with them. However, aspirants should be creative. There are plenty of opportunities to do situationally powerful things. 

### Range
In general, narrative magic abilities have a range of 10m. If you use a magic power outside that range, similar negatives to those imposed on ranged attacks apply.

### Channelling
These disciplines are all considered under the channelling skill and can be used immediately by pulling energy or manipulating magic in the world around you. Generally, to do any channelled magic, you will need a focus and crystallized magic with the magical capacity to help you cast the spell.

#### Abjuration
The act of manipulating magic itself and protecting against things. A character could use abjuration magic to create a protective barrier, disrupt a spell or curse, stop a troll's regeneration.

#### Evocation
The act of manipulating energy. A character could use evocation to start a fire, freeze an object, shoot energy from their hands.

#### Illusion
The act of manipulating perception. A character could use illusion to hide themselves, make otherworldly noise, summon a phantasm.

#### Transmutation
The act of manipulating matter. A character could use transmutation to alter their form, make a weapon out of junk, create wine from water.

#### Crystallized Magic
Crystallized magic is an infused or naturally magically resonant material that allows a channeller to transform pure magic into effects on the material world. Crystallized magic is necessary to perform any meaningful magical effect, it can be purchased like any other equipment. When casting a spell, you need to expend a unit of crystallized magic per level of the spell, so amateur spells require 1 unit, expert 2, and master 3. If you do not succeed, there is a 50% chance that the crystallized magic is not expended. 

#### Focus
Some channelled abilities will require you to remain focused on them. A character can focus on 1 channelled spell at a time and while focusing any additional channels performed are at a -2. Generally, after an hour of channelling a spell, a character needs to make an athletics test or become exhausted and be forced to end the channel. This test repeats every hour.

### Ritual
These disciplines are all considered under the Ritual skill and are related to lengthier magic processes but also more powerful. A ritual will usually require time, reagents, and some form of ritual.

#### Conjuration
The process of creating matter. A character could use conjuration to summon a familiar, a monster, or food. They could also teleport large distances.

  

#### Divination
The process of revealing information. A character could use divination to attempt to see the future, perceive over a long distance, detect magic or other forces.

  

#### Enchanting
The process of affecting people and things. A character could use enchanting to charm a person into trusting them, curse a place to slowly rot, imbue a sword with magical power.

  

#### Necromancy
The process of controlling life itself. A character could use necromancy to resurrect the dead, commune with spirits, control the undead, manipulate age and life force.

### Spells
Magic in Aspirant should be open, free flowing, inspired, and created on the spot with the GM assigning a difficulty and requirements to any ritual or spell that a character wants to perform at the moment. However, to help to guide players and GM’s a set of guidelines is provided in the relevant training.

### Combat
The 4 channelling disciplines can directly be used in combat. Illusion and Abjuration in more narrative ways, but transmutation and evocation have more direct rules available.

### Magic Traits
These are traits that magical attacks can have applied to them. Adding them increases or decreases the skill test difficulty by the value in brackets. A spell attack has a related spell difficulty. An amateur spell caster can perform up to a -1 difficulty spell attack, expert -3, master any difficulty:
