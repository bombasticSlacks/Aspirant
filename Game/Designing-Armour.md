## Designing [Armour](Armour)
### Crafting
A character looking to craft a specific armour first requires 2 size worth of the primary material. Some advanced armours such as quilted cotton or plate mail would require additional layering of the material, meaning it will take 2 times the materials. Other bits, unless narratively relevant, are a negligible portion of the cost. Then, the character, as a downtime activity, may spend a day crafting. If they succeed on the [Crafting](Crafting) test, the item is created successfully. If not, they must try again in the future; however, materials are not lost, just time. 

The difficulty of the test is modified as follows:

* Exotic Materials -1
* Double Layered - 1
* Poor facilities -1
* Excellent facilities +1
