## Designing [Armour](Armour)
Through play and when creating a character, you may desire to protect yourself with armour. You can use one of the [Example-Armour](Example-Armour) or design your own. Perhaps your village or character has a unique type of armour, or you encounter a blacksmith who has an idea for a unique piece of armour. 

To build a piece of armour:
- Choose if it is Basic, Martial, or Exotic
- Choose Material(s)
- Select a number of traits for the armour equal to the amount available based on quality and material
- 
### Materials
Armour is made of [materials](materials), which determine its characteristics, see [Materials](Armour#Materials) for more details. Martial or Exotic [Quality](Armour#Quality) armour will require a small amount of secondary material to reinforce, pad, or affix the primary material to. Materials, whether they be the primary or secondary material, will also give access to material specific [Armour-Traits](Armour-Traits) for Martial and Exotic armours.
 
### Crafting
A character looking to craft a specific armour first requires 3 size worth of the primary material and 1/2 size worth of secondary material where applicable. Other bits, unless narratively relevant, are a negligible portion of the cost. Then, the character, as a downtime activity, may spend a day crafting. If they succeed on the [Crafting](Crafting) test, the item is created successfully. If not, they must try again in the future; however, materials are not lost, just time. 

The difficulty of the test is modified as follows:

* Exotic Materials -1
* Traits -1 per each
* Poor facilities -1
* Excellent facilities +1
