# Designing [[Armour]]
Through play and when creating a character, you may desire to protect yourself with armour. You can use one from the [[Equipment-List]] or design your own. Perhaps your village or character has a unique type of armour, or you encounter a blacksmith who has an idea for a unique piece of armour. 

To build a piece of armour:
- Choose the [[#Quality|Quality]]
- Choose [[#Materials|Materials]]
- Calculate the [[#Base Armour Value|Base Armour Value]]
- Select any [[#Tradeoffs]]
- Select any [[#Features|Features]]

## Quality
Armour comes in various qualities based on the skill required to craft.
### Basic
*Basic armour is improvised, hastily constructed, or primitive in nature, but may save your life when no other options are available.* 
* Use 2 materials of at least [[Materials#Basic]] quality.
* Has the stats of [[Basic-Armour]]


### Artisan

*Artisan armour is expressly built for the hardships of battle. When compared to basic armour, artisan armour is more complex and more meticulously constructed, often with specific functions in mind.*
* Use 2 materials, of at least [[Materials#Artisan]] quality.
* Have 1 [[#Features|Features]]
* May take 1 [[#Tradeoffs|Tradeoffs]]

### Exotic
*Exotic armours incorporate additional complexity of both materials and design allowing for further specialization of enhanced functionality thanks to the use of rare and advanced materials and expert craftsmanship.*
* Use 2 materials, of at least [[Materials#Exotic]] quality.
* Have 2 [[#Features|Features]]
* May take 1 [[#Tradeoffs|Tradeoffs]]
* Has the [[Exotic-Attire]] [[Armour-Traits]].

### Master Work
*Master worked armour is an artisan or exotic armour of exceptional craftsmanship and design.* 
* A piece of masterwork armour gains 1 additional [[#Features|Features]]
* May take 2 [[#Tradeoffs|Tradeoffs]]. 

### Relic
Armours that go beyond what could be possible with enchanting or standard craftsmanship can be considered relics. They may still be crafted, but would require more narrative investment then a simple skill roll.


## Materials
Armour is made of [[Materials]], which determine its characteristics, see [[#Material Table]] for more details. 

### Material Table
This is a list of the base values an armour with each material might have.

| Material                  | Skill Penalty | Integrity | Weakness                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [[Textiles]] | (+1)          | 2         | [[Injury#Rending]]   |
| [[Hide]]         | (+1)          | 2         | [[Injury#Impact]]     |
| [[Bits]]         | (0)           | 4         | [[Injury#Piercing]] |
| [[Liquid]]     | (-1)          | 6         | [[Injury#Life]]         |
| [[Metal]]       | (-1)          | 6         | [[Injury#Cold]]         |
| [[Resonant]] | (0)           | 2         | Your Choice                           |
| [[Flora]]       | (0)           | 4         | [[Injury#Heat]]         |

> Some armour concepts are obvious, such as metal, textiles and hide. Consider liquid to be things like epoxy, oil quenching, chemical treatments. Bits to be, bone, quills, feathers, living rock. Resonant to be crystals, powders and gemstones. Flora to be vines, woods and roots. 


## Base Armour Value
 The base attributes for a suit of armour is as follows;

| Attribute         | Calculation         |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Skill Penalty     | Primary + Secondary |
| Integrity         | Primary + Secondary |
| Weakness          | Primary Weakness    |
| Critical Weakness | Secondary Weakness  |
| Resistance        | -                   |

> So an armour with a primary material of metal and a secondary of textiles would result in having a skill penalty of 0, an integrity of 6, and a weakness to rending damage.

## Tradeoffs
Some armour sacrifices in one way to gain power in another. For each tradeoff you do you gain an additional [[#Features|Features]]. Tradeoffs are (can be selected more than once):
- Gain 2 [[Armour#Critical Weakness]]
- Make a [[Armour#Critical Weakness]] into a [[Armour#Weakness and Resistance]]
- Reduce [[Armour#Armour Integrity]] by 2
- Increase [[Armour#Reaction Penalty]] by 1.


## Features
 Can be spent to further modify armour. Features are (each selectable more than once):
 * Add an [[Armour-Traits]] that can be justified based on the armour.
 * Add 2 [[Armour#Armour Integrity]].
 * Reduce [[Armour#Reaction Penalty]] by 1.
 * Remove 2 [[Armour#Critical Weakness]]
 * Make a [[Armour#Weakness and Resistance]] into a [[Armour#Critical Weakness]]
 * Gain a [[Armour#Weakness and Resistance]] and a [[Armour#Critical Weakness]]



 
## Crafting Cost
Creating armour requires 4 size worth of the primary material, and 1 size worth of secondary material. Other bits, unless narratively relevant, are a negligible portion of the cost.
