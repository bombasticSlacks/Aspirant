### Basic

#### Defensive Offhand
When holding two weapons of size 2 or less, the smaller of the two gets the [Balanced](Weapon-Traits#Balanced) trait.

#### Double Strike
When holding two weapons of size 2 or less, you may choose to perform a double strike attack in melee. This is a single melee skill test with an additional -1 modifier. If you hit the opponent, roll damage for each weapon separately, they take the worst of the two injuries. If their armour mitigates the attack, it suffers an additional 2 integrity damage.

#### Massive Inertia
Other Dual Wielding training can be used with any size weapon.

#### Multitasking
On your turn, you may make an attack at -2 additional difficulty, and then perform a non-attack action or movement.

#### Head Down
If you move during your turn, enemies suffer a -2 to hit you with ranged attacks until your next turn.

#### Lash Out
After attacking, you may throw a weapon of a smaller size as a seperate attack.

### Advanced

#### Ambidextrous
When holding two weapons/items of size 2 or less during combat, you can take a single action with each weapon, though each suffers a -1.

#### Strike Together
 If you haven’t moved this turn or last, if you attack with both your weapons, your target may only react to one of these attacks. 

#### Hyper Block
You can block and parry ranged projectiles. 

#### Quick Draw
If you spend 2 [Power](Stats#Power), you can make an attack with a size 1 weapon as a free action.

### Master
#### Whirlwind
As a special manoeuvre, you can Whirlwind Attack. This manoeuvre means you can make an individual melee attack against a number of enemies that you moved within 2m of this turn, up to your AGI in total enemies. Each [Injuring Attack](Combat#Injuring%20Attack) is at a negative to damage equal to the number of people being attacked but otherwise, is treated as a regular melee attack.

#### Battle Step
Each round of combat, you receive 1 additional reaction that can only be used to dodge.
