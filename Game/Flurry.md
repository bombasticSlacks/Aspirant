#TODOcopy

### Basic

#### Defensive Offhand
When holding two weapons of size 2 or less, the smaller of the two gets the [Balanced](Weapon-Traits#Balanced)trait.

#### Double Strike
When holding two weapons of size 2 or less, you may choose to perform a double strike attack in melee. This is a single melee skill test with an additional -1 modifier. If you hit the opponent, roll damage for each weapon separately, they take the worst of the two injuries. If their armour mitigates the attack, it suffers an additional 2 integrity damage.

#### Massive Inertia
Other Dual Wielding training can be used with any size weapon.

#### Multitasking
On your turn, you may make an attack at -2 additional difficulty, and then perform a non-attack action or movement.

#### Quick Draw
AGI times per meditation, you can make an attack with a size 1 weapon as a free action.

---

### Advanced

#### Ambidextrous
When holding two weapons/items of size 2 or less during combat, you can take a single action with each weapon, though each suffers a -1.

#### Niten Ichi-Ryu
#TODOoverloaded 
When using two weapons and one is larger than the other, you may Strike Together, and Lash Out

Strike Together - A special manoeuvre where, if you haven’t moved this turn, you may make a basic attack with each of your weapons. Your opponent may only react to one of these attacks. 

Lash Out - You can throw your smaller weapon as a free action.
