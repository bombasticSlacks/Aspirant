# Munitions
Weapons with a [Capacity](Weapon-Traits#Capacity(X,%20Type)) will require munitions of some kind that will be of a tier. The simplest forms of munitions just function as a cost to use these weapons. Every weapon will require a quality of munition, [Basic Munitions](#Basic%20Munitions), [Artisan Munitions](#Artisan%20Munitions), or [Exotic Munitions](#Exotic%20Munitions).

Specialty ammunition exists however and could potentially influence [Damage Type](Weapons#Damage%20Type), add effects, or even increase or reduce [Damage](Game/Core/Terminology#Damage).

## Munition Size
Munitions may have a size of "M" which means that 5 can be stored per 1 [Size](Game/Handling-Equipment#Size).

## Munition Shape
Munitions are not interchangeable, a crossbow doesn't shoot arrows, a bow doesn't fire bolts. Munitions come in many shapes but some commonplace ones are:
* Arrow
* Bolt
* Bullet
* Shot
* Ball
* Fuel

## Basic Munitions
Basic objects like arrows.

## Artisan Munitions
More complex objects like bolts and simple fuels.

## Exotic Munitions
Advanced ammos like explosive charges and advanced chemicals.

## SCRATCH
Food 3 tiers (basic, artisan, exotic) - basic gain a stress, if you eat artisan no stress, if you eat exotic you get a stress back. Masterwork gives a trait from ingested and applied.

Munitions are costed per type. So arrows are basic, bolts are artisan, lead balls are exotic. You can add modifiers by crafting a higher tier of the thing. So flaming arrows are artisan. piercing bolts are exotic. Modified bullets would need to be masterworked. Exotic munitions require special training like weapons. 

Potions and such are based on their effect. Need to make a list…
