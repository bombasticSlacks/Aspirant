# Munitions
Weapons with a [[Weapon-Traits#Capacity(X, Type]]) will require munitions of some kind that will be of a tier. The simplest forms of munitions just function as a cost to use these weapons. Every weapon will require a quality of munition, [[#Basic Munitions|Basic Munitions]], [[#Artisan Munitions|Artisan Munitions]], or [[#Exotic Munitions|Exotic Munitions]].

Specialty ammunition exists however and could potentially influence [[Weapons#Damage Type]], add effects, or even increase or reduce [[Terminology#Damage]].

## Munition Size
Munitions may have a size of "M" which means that 5 can be stored per 1 [[Handling-Equipment#Size]].

## Munition Shape
Munitions are not interchangeable, a crossbow doesn't shoot arrows, a bow doesn't fire bolts. Munitions come in many shapes but some commonplace ones are:
### Arrow
### Bolt
### Bullet
### Shot
### Ball
### Fuel

### Stone

## Basic Munitions
Basic objects like arrows.

## Artisan Munitions
More complex objects like bolts and simple fuels.

## Exotic Munitions
Advanced ammos like explosive charges and advanced chemicals.
