Weapon [[Equipment]] can normally be separated into 3 categories: Basic, Martial and Exotic. Anyone can use a Basic weapon without difficulty. A Martial or Exotic weapon would require additional training.

In the world of Aspirant, there are plenty of unique weapons to be found and experienced. Some examples will be provided, along with rules for creating your own weapons in each category.

### Basic
Basic weapons are simple tools, improvised items, rudimentary weapons or other implements not built intentionally for harm.

*All basic weapons have a -1 damage bonus and 0 traits.*

### Martial
Martial weapons are properly built tools of war. They require some training to use properly and have unique advantages over using a basic weapon.

*All martial weapons have a +1 damage bonus and 1 traits.*

### Exotic Weapons
Exotic weapons have additional complexity over basic martial weapons. Their mechanisms are more complex or their chance of self injury is higher. They require additional training on top of the training required for martial weapons to be used successfully.

*All exotic weapons have a +1 damage bonus and 2 traits.*

### Master Work
A masterful blacksmith can do a lot to imbue an item with additional power and versatility. A master work weapon may have an additional trait beyond those it otherwise might have. It must be made of materials of similar quality to an exotic weapon.

### Size
Weapons, like all items, come in various sizes. However, in the case of weapons, an item's size has more effect than just the required storage space. 
- A weapon's size is added to its damage bonus
- Weapons of size 1-2 require one hand
- Weapons of size 3-4 require two hands
- Weapons of size 5 cannot be traditionally wielded by adventurers

```
Examples of weapons sizes are as follows:
Size 1 - Dagger, hammer, knife
Size 2 - Arming Sword, Mace, Truncheon
Size 3 - Long sword, Warhammer, Spear
Size 4 - Lance, Great Sword
Size 5 - Giant Weapons
```

> So, for example, a long sword is a size 3 weapon. This means it is two-handed, gets +3 damage bonus.

### Damage Type
Weapons can usually have any of the physical damage types Pierce, Rend, Impact. This will affect what injuries it will cause and what armour will defend against it. Fabrics tend to be strong against Impact, plates against Rend, and weaves against Pierce. 

### Traits
Abilities or unique effects a weapon might possess. This list is non-exhaustive if you have an idea in mind as a player or game master trying to work something out that the players and game master are happy with.  Traits have an associated cost, which is the number of trait points it counts as.

A list of example traits is provided in the [glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pjotbn26OeQPVqfVwTOxSper5irKWGEU5Zs8rtsO9zI/edit#heading=h.d4inktlof09f).

### Acquiring Weapons

### Buying
Weapons generally cost materials + 5 per trait (powerful counts as 2) in silver. Master worked weapons will cost an additional 10 silver on top of this. Example weapons are provided in the [glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pjotbn26OeQPVqfVwTOxSper5irKWGEU5Zs8rtsO9zI/edit#heading=h.7drl3agje2d7).
