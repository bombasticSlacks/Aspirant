## How To Play
### The Players
The players, characters, heroes, adventurers etc. refers to the group of people that the players playing the game control directly. They will have motivations, plans, ideas, abilities, and be directed by the players themselves.

### GM
The GM, or, game master is the person who directs the flow of the game. They set up the initial state of the world, potentially with [help from the players](First-Session), then control every non-player character and entity in it.

### Dice
In Aspirant, every action is resolved by rolling 2d6 + modifier. In every case, there will be a relevant skill and stat associated with the action being attempted. To obtain your modifier, add your skill value + stat value - difficulty = modifier (where difficulty is assigned by the DM and defaults to 0). After determining the modifier, you then roll and if roll + modifier >= 10 you succeed and otherwise you fail. A roll of 2 on 2d6 always counts as a failure.

Common modifiers include: rushed (-1), high pressure (-1), non-trivial (-1), complicated task (-2), challenging (-3), hellish task (-5), impossible task (-7).

There are some special dice rolls which you will be called upon to perform. A few of these include damage, determining where people are hit and initiative. These will be explained in detail within this book.

NOTE, The rules provided within this section are not supposed to be exhaustive. This is a set of guidelines to give players and game masters an idea of what is possible, and how it should be determined. Generally, you should try to never say “no” to a player's impulse. You should inform them of the difficulty of a task and from there they can make an informed decision on if they want to progress.
