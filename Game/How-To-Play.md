## How To Play
### The Players
The players, characters, heroes, adventurers etc. refers to the group of people that the players playing the game control directly. They will have motivations, plans, ideas, abilities, and be directed by the players themselves.

### First Time Players
If it is your first time playing Aspirant, you should do the following:
* Read up on [Stats](Stats) and [Skills](Skills). These are critical to playing the game
* Create characters from [Humble Beginnings](Humble-Beginnings)
* Have a [First Session](First-Session) to discuss your histories
* Get into the game and start [Telling The Story](Telling-The-Story)

### GM
The GM, or, game master is the person who directs the flow of the game. They set up the initial state of the world, potentially with [help from the players](First-Session), then control every non-player character and entity in it.

More guidelines for the GM are provided in [Running The Game](Running-The-Game).

### Dice
![dice-icons](Content/dice-icons.svg)
In Aspirant, every action is resolved by rolling 2d6 + modifier. In every case, there will be a relevant [Skill](Skills) and [Stat](Stats) associated with the action being attempted. To obtain your modifier
$$skill\ value + stat\ value - difficulty = modifier$$ 
Difficulty is assigned by the GM and defaults to 0. After determining the modifier, you then roll. 
* If roll + modifier >= 10 you succeed.
* Otherwise, you fail. 
* A roll of 2 on 2d6 always counts as a failure.
* A roll of 12 on 2d6 always counts as a success.
* Players should not get to make skill tests for impossible actions.

Common modifiers include: rushed (-1), high pressure (-1), non-trivial (-1), complicated task (-2), challenging (-3), hellish task (-5), impossible task (-7). [Skills](Skills) will also provide some examples.

There are some special dice rolls which you will be called upon to perform. A few of these include [Dealing Damage](Attacks#Dealing%20Damage), and [Initiative Value](Combat#Initiative%20Value). #TODODamage 

**NOTE**, The rules provided within this section are not supposed to be exhaustive. This is a set of guidelines to give players and game masters an idea of what is possible, and how it should be determined. Generally, you should try to never say “no” to a player's impulse. You should inform them of the difficulty of a task and from there they can make an informed decision on if they want to progress.

### Making Characters
To make a character, you should refer to:
 * [Stats](Stats)
 * [Skills](Skills)
 * [Character-Creation](Character-Creation)

### Playing The Game
To play the game, you should refer to:
* [First Session](First-Session)
* [Telling The Story](Telling-The-Story)
* [Combat](Combat)
* [Injury](Injury)
