# Designing [[Consumable]]
The world is filled with concoctions, tinctures, salves, medicines and other consumables. In some cases you may want to design your own, either for [[Crafting]].

To build a consumable:
* Choose the [[#Quality]]
* Select any [[#Tradeoffs]]
* Select any [[#Features]]


## Quality
### Basic
*Basic consumables made from simple ingredients.*
* Use a single material of at least [[Materials#Basic]] quality.
* May take 1 [[#Tradeoffs]].

### Artisan
*Thoughtful material is mixed to provide some powerful effects.*
* Use a single material of at least [[Materials#Artisan]] quality.
* May have 1 [[#Features]], traits can be artisan or basic.
* May have 1 [[#Tradeoffs]]
### Exotic
*Strange materials have been used to imbue this item with power.*
* Use a single material of at least [[Materials#Exotic]] quality.
* May have 1 [[#Features]], can select any traits.
* May have 1 [[#Tradeoffs]]
* Has the [[Exotic-Application]] [[Consumable-Traits]].

### Masterwork
*A master has managed to take this object and what it is made of to its limits.*
* A masterwork [[Consumable]] gains 1 additional [[#Featurer|feature]].
* May take an additional [[#Tradeoffs|tradeoff]].
## Tradeoffs
You've sacrificed to gain power elsewhere. For each tradeoff taken you gain an additional [[#Features|feature]] that your mixture qualifies for.
* A [[Consumable-Traits]] that is a tradeoff.
* Requires an additional [[Materials|material]] of a different [[Materials#Material Types|material type]] of the required [[#Quality]].

## Features
Uniquely consumables features become more pronounced and powerful as the quality of materials and skill increases. When selecting a feature you may select from any quality that your consumable is at least.

* A [[Consumable-Traits]] this consumable qualifies for.
* This consumable is food. It produces 5 times as much but has the [[Food]] [[Consumable-Traits]]. 
* This [[Consumable]] has the [[Small]] trait.
* This [[Consumable]] can be used twice before being consumed.
