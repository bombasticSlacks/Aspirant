Or gravity shifts in a direction for the same duration.<br><br>Stasis discharge: Everything in the area is stunned for a turn.<br><br>Magnesium Bomb: Everything in the area suffers an exothermic attack that causes a critical injury to a location and is on fire.<br><br>Corrosive Gas: Everything in the area loses all resistance for its armour|
