### Additional Attributes
On top of the above stats, your character also has a few additional values:

#### Total XP
An abstraction of your characters potential to learn and gain new abilities. [[Character-Development]] has details on how to spend this.

#### Spent XP
Aspirants will not immediately spend experience as they gain it, expertise comes from the knowledge of others so your spent XP should be tracked seperately from your total.

#### Move Speed
How far your character can move in 1 turn of combat. AGI * 2 meters.

#### Initiative
Your AGI + INT. Used to determine turn order in combat.

#### Passive Perception
Your Perception skill bonus.

#### Threat
The size of your largest weapon. Used to determine who unintelligent monsters target at random.

#### Heroism
Determined by your total XP. Used to survive attacks, show bravery, etc.

|XP|Bonuses|
|---|---|
|0-9|Heroism +0|
|10-19|Heroism +1|
|20-29|Heroism +2|
|30+|Heroism +3|

#### Max Toxicity
Your characters can only handle a certain amount of foreign material in your body before becoming ill.

Characters have a Max Toxicity equal to their STR + RES attributes. Your max toxicity is reduced by 1 for any permanent enchantment, prosthetic with additional abilities, and mutation your character possesses. Whenever you imbibe an alchemical elixir or are positively affected by some form of magic your character marks a level of Toxicity when your characters Toxicity level is equal to or greater than your Max Toxicity you are considered injured.

Toxicity resets to 0 during downtime.
