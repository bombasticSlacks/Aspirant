## Stats
Values your character should track related to the game.

### Attributes
Attributes range in value from 1-5 and measure your capability to do almost anything.
- 1 is below human
- 2 is human average
- 3 is remarkable
- 4 is the peak of human achievement
- 5 is inhuman

Your character has 5 primary attributes that dictate what they can do:
* [Strength](Strength)
* [Agility](Agility)
* [Intelligence](Intelligence)
* [Communication](Communication)
* [Spirit](Spirit)

### Additional Attributes
On top of the above attributes, your character also has a few additional values:

#### Total XP
An abstraction of your characters' potential to learn and gain new abilities. [Character-Development](Character-Development) has details on how to spend this.

#### Spent XP
Aspirants will not immediately spend experience as they gain it, expertise comes from the knowledge of others, so your spent XP should be tracked separately from your total.

#### Max Power
A stat tracking how many times your character can perform certain powerful abilities. Some [Training](Character-Development#Training) will require you to expend this resource. It can be regained using the [Good Night's Rest](Activities#Good%20Night's%20Rest) [Travel Activity](Activities#Travel%20Activity).

Power is equal to [Intelligence](Intelligence) + 1 per [Training](Character-Development#Training) that requires power.

#### Movement Distance
How far your character can comfortably move before suffering a penalty to actions when time is important. See [Movement](Movement) for more details.

Movement Distance is based on your [Agility](Agility)

| Agility | Distance                |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| 1       | -                       |
| 2       | [Reach](Movement#Reach) |
| 3       | [Close](Movement#Close) |
| 4       | [Short](Movement#Short) |
| 5       | [Far](Movement#Far)     |

#### Threat
The size of your largest weapon. Used to determine who unintelligent monsters target at random. 

* A character that is unarmed still has a base threat of 1. 
* A character that is unconscious or otherwise detained should have a threat of 0.

#### Max Affinity
When [Using Magic Items](Magic-Items#Using%20Magic%20Items) the number you can [Bind](Terminology#Bind).

Affinity is equal to your [Spirit](Spirit).

#### Max Influence
A measure of the influence you as a player have over the story. See [Influencing the Story](Telling-The-Story#Influencing%20the%20Story) for more details.

You start with [Communication](Communication) influence, and can have a maximum influence equal to [Communication](Communication).
