#### Spent XP
Aspirants will not immediately spend experience as they gain it, expertise comes from the knowledge of others so your spent XP should be tracked seperately from your total.

#### Power
A stat tracking how many times you character can perform certain powerful abilities. Some [Training](Character-Development#Training) will require you to expend this resource. It can be regained using the [Meditate](Telling-The-Story#Meditate) [Evening Activity](Telling-The-Story#Evening%20Activity).

Power is equal to 2 + 1 per [Training](Character-Development#Training) that requires power.

#### Max Toxicity
Your characters can only handle a certain amount of foreign material in your body before becoming ill.

Characters have a Max Toxicity equal to their STR + RES attributes. Your max toxicity is reduced by 1 for any permanent enchantment, prosthetic with additional abilities, and mutation your character possesses. Whenever you imbibe an alchemical elixir or are positively affected by some form of magic your character marks a level of Toxicity when your characters Toxicity level is equal to or greater than your Max Toxicity you are considered injured.

Toxicity resets to 0 during downtime.
