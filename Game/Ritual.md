## Ritual
One of the [Skills](Skills) in Aspirant. 

Understanding ancient powers, interacting with large magical devices, performing rituals of [Conjurer](Conjurer), [Diviner](Diviner), [Enchanter](Enchanter), and [Vitomancer](Vitomancer) magic. These rituals are lengthier magic processes, but also more powerful. A ritual skill test will usually require time, reagents, and some form of ritual process.

### Stat Used
[Resolve](Stats#Resolve) skill.

### Mundane Activities
There are no mundane ritual activities, everything requires a skill test.

### Restrictions
Unlike with most skills, ritual is a complex field. There is a limit on what activities you can attempt to cast based on discipline and training. Without [Attuned](Magic-Training#Attuned) you cannot use the ritual skill.

> So, a character with [Amateur Abjuration](Abjurer#Amateur%20Abjuration) can at most attempt the magical feats described there, anything beyond that would be impossible. 

Even with training you still need:
* [Materials](Materials)
* [Reagent Bag](Example-Gear#Reagent%20Bag)

### Example Activities

Magic in Aspirant should be open, free flowing, inspired, and created on the spot with the GM assigning a difficulty and requirements to any ritual that a character wants to perform at the moment. However, to help to guide players and GM’s a set of guidelines is provided in the trainings that you get.
