# Travelling

Travelling in Aspirant can take long amounts of time. Travelling involves knowing the direction or location of something and then travelling towards it. Travel will usually take a number of days. To travel you require at minimum [[Camping-Gear]].

## Travel Segment

For simplicity, travel is:

- Simply, the time to get from one location to another
- Most travel should focus on hitting a milestone of some kind at least within 5 days. Travel should be directed to get somewhere. Unstructured travel isn't travel, it is adventuring.
- A full day of travel is considered 14 hours of continual travel, this gives the characters ample time to rest.
- Characters need to manage their [[Stress#Needs]].
- At the beginning of travel [[#Travel Roles]] must be determined.
- A travel segment will have a [[#Segment Danger]].
- A travel segment will have a [[#Segment Time]].
- A travel segment may have [[#Segment Modifiers]].
- Characters will experience a [[#Night Encounter]].
- Characters will experience a [[#Route Encounter]].

### Night Encounter
During their time camping something eventful will happen to the players. It can be as simple as a description of the night sky, fireflies out, or a companion telling a story from their childhood. 

This encounter depending on [[#Segment Danger]] might be dangerous instead.

### Route Encounter
During their time traveling something eventful will happen to the players. It can be as simple as a description of the local flowers, a passing caravan saying hello, or a shift in the weather. More involved events such as encountering other travellers, enemies or a point of interest could occur.

This encounter depending on [[#Segment Danger]] might be dangerous instead.

Players should only experience 1 route encounter per travel segment. If your players were attacked by wolves a number of times travelling through a forest, instead, that should be handled as one extended narrative / combat [[Terminology#Scene]] where they realize they’ve entered dangerous territory and need to navigate out of it.

### Segment Time
In Aspirant movement between places should be measured in time, not distance. So a place might be a days travel, or 4 days travel, from where you are. 

### Segment Danger
Each route will have a rating between 1-6 for danger. When traveling the GM should secretly roll 2 6 sided dice to see what sorts of events the characters will experience. For each dice that comes up with less than or equal to the danger rating the players experience a dangerous encounter. This can either be their [[#Night Encounter]] or [[#Route Encounter]], or, if both dice roll dangerous, both encounters will be dangerous.
> A route has a danger rating of 3. The GM secretly rolls a 2 and a 4, this means one dangerous encounter and one normal, they decide the players will have a dangerous night encounter and a normal route encounter. 

### Segment Modifiers
Some travel segments will have specific modifiers. 
* Maybe its dangerously hot, cold, you can get sick. 
* Some travel segments will restrict types of [[Asset]], no [[Asset#Vehicles]], no horses, etc.
* Maybe no [[Activities#Travel Activity]] can be performed. 

## Travel Roles
While traveling certain characters become responsible for certain tasks to help make life easier. Everyone else is considered a passenger and may perform a [[Activities#Travel Activity]].
### Quartermaster
_You find a camping spot, lead setup and organize watch for the team, taking extra shifts when necessary._
- You may perform [[Application]](-[[#Segment Danger]]) to make a dangerous [[#Night Encounter]] into a positive or neutral one.
- You are ready and unsurprised during a [[#Night Encounter]].
### Navigator
_You plan the journey and lead the group._
- You may perform [[Awareness]](-[[#Segment Danger]]) to make a dangerous [[#Route Encounter]] into a positive or neutral one.
- You are ready and unsurprised during a [[#Route Encounter]].
### Cook
_You hunt, forage, and provide for the group._
- You may perform an [[Coordination]](-[[#Segment Danger]]) to provide for everyone. Everyone traveling considers their [[Stress#Needs]] met.

## Travel Speed
Some [[Asset]] or abilities may increase the travel speed of characters. Humans have a travel speed of 1x, a traveling groups speed is equal to the lowest speed among them.
