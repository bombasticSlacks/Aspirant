## Channel
One of the [Skills](Skills) in Aspirant. 

Invoking the power of magical items, channeling [Abjurer](Abjurer), [Evoker](Evoker), [Illusionist](Illusionist), or [Transmuter](Transmuter) power. Creates immediate effects by pulling energy or manipulating magic in the world around you.

### Stat Used
[Resolve](Stats#Resolve) skill.

### Mundane Activities
There are no mundane channel actions there should always be a chance to fail.

### Restrictions
Unlike with most skills, channeling is a complex field. There is a limit on what actviities you can attempt to cast based on discipline and [Magic-Training](Magic-Training). Without [Attuned](Magic-Training#Attuned) you cannot use the channel skill.

> So, a character with [Amateur Abjuration](Abjurer#Amateur%20Abjuration) can at most attempt the magical feats described there, anything beyond that would be impossible. 

Even with training you still need:
* [Crystallized Magic](Example-Gear#Crystallized%20Magic)
* [Focus](Example-Gear#Focus)

#### Maintaining Focus
Some channelled abilities will require you to remain focused on them. A character can focus on 1 channelled spell at a time and while focusing any additional channels performed are at a -2. Generally, after an hour of channelling a spell, a character needs to make an athletics test or become exhausted and be forced to end the [Channel](Channel). This test repeats every hour.

### Example Activities

| Description                  | [Untrained](Skills#Untrained) | Skill Modifier |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Amateur Spell Under Pressure |                               | 0              |
| Expert Spell Under Pressure  |                               | -1             |
| Master Spell Under Pressure  |                               | -2             |

Magic in Aspirant should be open, free flowing, inspired, and created on the spot with the GM assigning a difficulty and requirements to any spell that a character wants to perform at the moment. However, to help to guide players and GM’s a set of guidelines is provided in the trainings that you get.

### Range
In general, narrative magic abilities have a range of 10m. If you use a magic power outside that range, similar negatives to those imposed on ranged attacks apply.

### Combat
The 4 channelling disciplines can directly be used in combat. Illusion and Abjuration in more narrative ways, but transmutation and evocation have more direct rules available.

### Magic Traits
