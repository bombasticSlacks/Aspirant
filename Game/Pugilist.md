While unarmed, you can Wing Strike, Swoop and Crane Kick.

Wing Strike - A melee attack combat modifier where if you succeed, your opponent is knocked back your strength rating in meters. If they bump into something, they fall prone.

Dragons Rush - After making an unarmed attack or manoeuvre if you haven’t already used this ability this turn, you may expend a reaction to attack again.

#### Drunk Boxing

Drunk Box – A special manoeuvre where you make a [Fellowship](Stats#Fellowship) + [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) test at -2.
