### Basic

#### Black Belt
You can attack unarmed as though you had a melee weapon with a damage bonus of 2 + [Strength](Stats#Strength). 

#### Flesh Prison
When a character attempts to escape a grapple you initiated, they receive an additional negative equal to either your [Strength](Stats#Strength) or [Agility](Stats#Agility).

#### Living Weapon
Your character always counts as armed and can, as long as they are conscious, always attack as though your hands were unbound.

#### Heavy Hitter
While wearing metal arm armour, you can parry and block using your arms and all of your attacks may knock back enemies [Strength](Stats#Strength) meters.

#### Throw
Your [Shove](Combat#Shove) makes people travel twice the distance.

### Advanced

Overwatch attacks always miss you. You can move out of melee without triggering attacks of opportunity.

#### Crane Kick
As a [Reaction](Combat#Reacting%20to%20Attacks), if an opponent is [Charging](Combat#Charging) you, you may make an unarmed attack that if successful causes their attack to fail and knocks them prone.

#### Drunk Boxing
A [Special Manoeuvre](Combat#Special%20Manoeuvres) where you make a [Fellowship](Stats#Fellowship) + [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) test at -2. If you succeed, then if an enemy attacks you in melee and succeeds, you ignore the attack. If they fail the attack, you make an attack that is a guaranteed hit against your opponent.

#### Dragon Rush
While unarmed, you can as [Reacting to Attacks](Combat#Reacting%20to%20Attacks), after making an unarmed attack or manoeuvre, if you havenâ€™t already used this ability this turn, you may expend your reaction to attack again.
