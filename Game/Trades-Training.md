#### Decadent
You never suffer penalties due to intoxication or exotic comestibles.

#### Find A Buyer
As a [Downtime Activities](Activities#Downtime%20Activity), you can spend a day finding someone interested in purchasing an item for full price (materials + labour). This is a skill test based on the settlement's Wealth + your [Converse](Converse), and a difficulty based on the rarity of the item.

#### Haggling
You may use converse to attempt to get better deals when commissioning items. This is an opposed [Converse](Converse) test against the craftsman. For every [Step Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success) you receive 1 silver off the asking price.

#### Name Your Price
You can buy any item, even a person's personal equipment.

#### Promissory Note
You can go into debt an amount of silver equal to 10 x [Fellowship](Fellowship) by writing promissory notes to merchants. You need to pay this off before you can use this ability again.

#### Suburbanite

#### Your Money Is Good Here
You always receive full value when exchanging currency.

### Advanced Training
#### Hard Sell
A merchant will never refuse to buy items from you, even if they have no interest in them.

#### I Packed It
Once per downtime, you can declare after the fact that you purchased an item while you were last resting in a settlement. The item would have to have been available, and you need to spend the equivalent currency it would have cost.

You also count as having an [Explorers Kit](Example-Gear#Explorers%20Kit), you can use it for [Power](Stats#Power) instead of silver.

#### Non-Target
As long as you have a [Threat](Stats#Threat) value of 1 or less, enemies don’t consider you a threat/combatant until you attack.
