### Basic Training
#### Find A Buyer
As a downtime activity, you can spend a day finding someone interested in purchasing an item for full price (materials + labour). This is a skill test based on the settlement's Wealth + your Converse, and a difficulty based on the rarity of the item.

#### Haggling
You may use converse to attempt to get better deals when commisioning items. This is an opposed converse test against the craftsman. For every step of success you recieve 1 silver off the asking price.

#### Clever Packer
Your backpack can hold an additional 6 size worth of items.

#### Name Your Price
You can buy any item, even a person's personal equipment.

#### Promissory Note
You can go into debt an amount of silver equal to 10 x FEL by writing promissory notes to merchants. You need to pay this off before you can use this ability again.

#### Your Money Is Good Here
You always receive full value when exchanging currency.

#### Babble
#TODOmigrate 
You may keep someone's attention and interest, even in a topic you know nothing about by using the perform skill.

#### Clothed Fighter
#TODOmigrate 
Your armour appears to others to just be clothing.

#### Decadent
You never suffer penalties due to intoxication or exotic comestibles.

#### Legal Expert
#TODOmigrate 
Your knowledge extends to the nuanced laws and customs of areas.

#### Military Expert
Your knowledge covers historical and strategic military knowledge.

#### Non-Target
As long as you have a [Threat](Stats#Threat) value of 1 or less, enemies don’t consider you a threat/combatant until you attack.

#### Second Identity
#TODOmigrate 
You have a second identity which you can assume at any time. While pretending to be this person, you don’t need to make fib tests about their life.

#### Suburbanite
You receive a +1 to all skill tests related to surviving and navigating urban areas.

#### What I Meant Was
#TODOmigrate 
Once per meditation during narrative time, after speaking to someone and hearing how they react, you may say “what I meant to say was…” and the original reaction will be forgotten with the conversation continuing as if it didn’t happen.

### Advanced Training

#### Hard Sell
A merchant will never refuse to buy items from you, even if they have no interest in them.

#### I Packed It
Once per downtime, you can declare after the fact that you purchased an item while you were last resting in a settlement. The item would have to have been available, and you need to spend the equivalent currency it would have cost.

#### Contacts
#TODOmigrate 
As a downtime action, you can spend a day setting up contacts in any location. This contact network can be queried for information and will send relevant info your way.
