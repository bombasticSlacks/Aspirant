Circle Parry – A Special Manoeuvre that behaves like parrying with the addition that your opponent receives a -2 to attack you. If your opponent fails to hit you, they drop their weapon.

Riposte – A modifier for when blocking. When blocking an opponent, you can take a -2 to your block. If you succeed, you can immediately make an attack or manoeuvre against that opponent.

You can opt to direct any head attacks to your body.|

#### Whirlwind

As a special manoeuvre, you can Whirlwind Attack. This manoeuvre means you can make an individual melee attack against a number of enemies that you moved within 2m of this turn, up to your AGI in total enemies. Each successful attack is at a negative to damage equal to the number of people being attacked but otherwise, is treated as a regular melee attack.|
