#TODOoverloaded 
When using a 1 handed [Piercing](Combat#Piercing) weapon with the balanced trait, you can circle parry, riposte and lunge.

Circle Parry – A Special Manoeuvre that behaves like parrying with the addition that your opponent receives a -2 to attack you. If your opponent fails to hit you, they drop their weapon.

Riposte – A modifier for when blocking. When blocking an opponent, you can take a -2 to your block. If you succeed, you can immediately make an attack or manoeuvre against that opponent.

Lunge – When you move into melee and attack in a turn, you add +1 to your damage roll.

#### Protect the Head
You can opt to direct any head attacks to your body.

### Master
#### Strike True
No negative to [Called Shot](Combat#Called%20Shot) with melee weapons.

#### Dance Of Death
While armed with a weapon of size 2 or less, you can Dance Of Death.

Dance Of Death - On your turn, as a free action, you may declare you are using dance of death and every opponent in melee with you must make an [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) test. If they succeed, whenever you move any distance they must choose to either move with you or take an immediate severe injury to the legs. If they fail their [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) test, they have to suffer a severe injury to the legs. Dance of death lasts until your next turn. Characters affected by dance of death that fail their [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) test cannot perform attacks of opportunity.
