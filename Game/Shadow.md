Strike at Will – You can draw your weapons at any time, including not on your turn and while surprised. After drawing your weapon for the first time, you receive a +1 to any skill tests against your opponents until your next turn.  

Mark Your Prey – At the beginning of combat, you can choose one enemy that is your “prey”. Any skill tests performed in relation to your prey are at a +1, and they are at a -1 to skill tests against you. Anyone you have spent more than 1-minute speaking to or have succeeded a converse test against also counts as your prey.

Hide In Waiting – If you are unarmed and have yet to show aggression towards anyone in a combat, enemies are considered unaware of you. 

#### Cold Steel
Weapons of size 1 you wield count as having the penetrative trait.

#### Preternatural Senses
You can manoeuvre perfectly well in the dark or when your vision is otherwise impaired.

#### Tour Guide
When rolling subterfuge to hide, move silently etc. you can include a small group of people at no negative. They don't need to make their own subterfuge skill test. 

#### Vanish
If within 3m of a piece of cover you can spend 3 [Power](Stats#Power) to lose all attention in the combat and act as though no one were aware of you until you draw attention to yourself. This can also be used out of combat for a similar effect, however out of combat it isn’t limited and requires a skill test.

You do not need an item or object to hide behind when attempting to hide.
