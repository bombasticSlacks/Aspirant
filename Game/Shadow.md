#### Obfuscate
Spend 2 [Power](Stats#Power), you can make any character/settlement re-roll a skill test related to discovering the party or their involvement in something.

#### Blank Slate
When caught doing something illegal, as long as you are not captured, it won’t be tied back to you (though may otherwise raise suspicion).

#### Bloody Mess

#### Defy Death
If you have an available reaction, you can always attempt to avoid an incoming attack, even if it would seem impossible to evade.

#### Fast Hands
You may attempt to [Disarm](Combat#Disarm) someone with a [Subterfuge](Subterfuge) instead of [Melee](Melee) skill test.

#### Juke
As a free action once per round, you can exchange places with another character in melee. You receive a +1 to rolls against this person during this combat round. After you enter a melee, you can reposition all the characters in it as long as they all remain in melee range (2m).

#### Light Step
You never trigger traps by moving over them. You also receive a +1 to [Subterfuge](Subterfuge) skill tests related to moving silently.

#### Lost in the Crowd
#TODOcopy 
Ranged attacks against you are at a -2 if you’ve been in melee until your next turn.

#### Mage Assassin
You can roll [Subterfuge](Subterfuge) to obfuscate the fact that a magical phenomenon has taken place.

#### Poisoner

#### Shadow Combatant
Your character's [Threat](Stats#Threat) is reduced by your ranks in [Subterfuge](Subterfuge).

#### Thievery
As [Skilled Work](Telling-The-Story#Skilled%20Work), you can pickpocket. Make a [Variable Difficulty](Skills#Variable%20Difficulty) [Subterfuge](Subterfuge) skill test, you receive settlement wealth - 1 silver per step of success. If you fail this skill test you may be in trouble with the law.

### Advanced
#### Assassination
When attacking an unaware target, if you succeed at the skill test you may choose for them to take a lethal injury or go unconscious.

#### Cold Steel
Weapons of size 1 you wield count as having the penetrative trait.

#### Preternatural Senses
You can manoeuvre perfectly well in the dark or when your vision is otherwise impaired.

#### Tour Guide
When rolling [Subterfuge](Subterfuge) to hide, move silently etc. you can include a small group of people at no negative. They don't need to make their own [Subterfuge](Subterfuge) skill test. 

#### Vanish
If within 3m of a piece of cover you can spend 3 [Power](Stats#Power) to lose all attention in the combat and act as though no one were aware of you until you draw attention to yourself. This can also be used out of combat for a similar effect, however out of combat it isn’t limited and requires a skill test.

### Master

#### Hide in Plain Sight
You do not need an item or object to hide behind when attempting to hide.

#### Master Thief
You may roll [Subterfuge](Subterfuge) to immediately use items and equipment stored on other characters in combat. Using the equipment would take the action it normally would.
