# Crafting
{: .no_toc }

Things in Aspirant are made. To make an item you need to have:
* A reference, guide, or training making it. [[Crafter|Crafters]] can make things without any other guide.
* Materials.
* A [[Craftsman-Kit]].

When you make something it will require, unless otherwise specified an amount of [[Materials]] equal to its size, with [[Materials#Material Quality]] dependent on its quality.

## Efficient Crafting
* When creating something if you use thematically appropriate [[Materials]] the [[Terminology#Game Master]] should either allow you to:
	* Use a worse but appropriate material ([[Materials#Artisan]] instead of [[Materials#Exotic]])
	* OR
	* 1 less [[Materials]].
