# Crafting
{: .no_toc }

Things in Aspirant are made. To make an item you need to have:
* A reference, guide, or training making it.
* Materials.
* A [Craftsman-Kit](Game/Gear/Craftsman-Kit).

When you make something it will require, unless otherwise specified an amount of [Materials](Game/Materials) equal to its size, with [Material Quality](Game/Materials#Material%20Quality) dependent on its quality.

## Efficient Crafting
* When creating something if you use thematically appropriate [Materials](Game/Materials) the [Game Master](Game/Core/Terminology#Game%20Master) should either allow you to:
	* Use a worse but appropriate material ([Artisan](Game/Materials#Artisan) instead of [Exotic](Game/Materials#Exotic))
	* OR
	* 1 less [Materials](Game/Materials).
