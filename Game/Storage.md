# Storage
In Aspirant, we aren’t concerned with the weight of items, size is a fair enough abstraction and any incredibly heavy items can be handled narratively. Storage specifics are also not relevant. If your characters divide a pot of 3 size of oil 3 ways, it is assumed you had containers on hand to store it. Similarly, if you pick up a new weapon and want to put it on your belt, it is assumed you can adjust your belt loops to support it.

## Storage Types
In Aspirant there are 3 types of storage which items will be in.
### General Storage
Items stowed for longer storage using the support of your core. Most of your characters storage will be general storage. General storage items can be drawn/stowed as an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action). General storage is the total amount of items your character can carry comfortably while being able to fight and act.

> A character who has 12 general storage could hold a 4 size item, 3 size item, 3 size item, and a 1 size item, they would not be able to store an additional 2 size item.
### Quick Access
Items readily available to your character. Quick access items can be drawn/stowed as a [Free Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Free%20Action). You can mark a size worth of items up to your quick access, as quick access, from your [General Storage](#General%20Storage). It takes a few minutes to adjust your quick access.

> A character has 10 general storage holding a great sword (size 4), healers kit (size 2), ammo (size 1), crossbow (size 3). If this character has 4 quick access, they could have immediate access to their great sword, or their crossbow + ammo, or their healers kit + ammo. 
### Camp Storage
Bigger longer term storage bags, sometimes saddled to horses or other pack animals, perhaps even a wagon. Camp storage is accessible at camp, while travelling, or during downtime. Usually a party will combine their party storage and all share traveling with it. 

## Specialization
Some storage will be specialized to be very effective at holding a certain type of thing. If you store something that your storage specializes in it counts as half size rounding up. 
Specializations are:
* [Gear](Game/Core/Gear)
* [Weapons](Game/Core/Weapons)
* [Materials](Game/Materials)
* [Armour](Game/Core/Armour)
