## Storage
Your character in general will have 16 size worth of storage on their character. That’s 6 in a bag, 4 on a belt and 6 in your horse's saddlebags. In Aspirant, we aren’t concerned with the weight of items, size is a fair enough abstraction and any incredibly heavy items can be handled narratively. Storage specifics are also not relevant. If your characters divide a pot of 3 size of oil 3 ways, it is assumed you had containers on hand to store it. Similarly, if you pick up a new weapon and want to put it on your belt, it is assumed you can adjust your belt loops to support it.

### Crafting Storage
Efficient storage requires numerous small latches and fixings and meticulous tailored pieces to come together into a functional piece. General costs for crafting different pieces of storage are as follows:
* Belts: Base cost of 10 silver for 4 units of storage.
* Bags and Saddlebags: Base cost of 5 silver for 6 units of storage.

Every type of storage can have up to 4 additional size, the first 2 cost 5 silver additionally each, the next 2 cost 10 silver additionally each. 

### Example Costs
So, a Belt with 6 storage would cost 10 silver for the base plus 10 silver for the additional 2 size of storage. Then the labour would generally cost 5 silver for 25 silver total.

### Customized Storage
Any bag can have its storage customized for a specific thing. This activity takes a tailor a day and allows you to convert 1 size of generic storage into 2 size of specialized storage or the other way. The types of specialized storage are: Bits, Weapons, Ammunition, Toolkits, Currency. Only items of that type can be stored in the related specialized storage.
