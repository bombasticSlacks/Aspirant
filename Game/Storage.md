## Storage
Your character in general will have 20 size worth of storage on their character which is how you hold [Equipment](Equipment). That’s 6 in a bag, 4 on a belt and 10 in your horse's saddlebags. In Aspirant, we aren’t concerned with the weight of items, size is a fair enough abstraction and any incredibly heavy items can be handled narratively. Storage specifics are also not relevant. If your characters divide a pot of 3 size of oil 3 ways, it is assumed you had containers on hand to store it. Similarly, if you pick up a new weapon and want to put it on your belt, it is assumed you can adjust your belt loops to support it.

### Belt
Items readily available to your character. Belted items can be drawn/stowed for free, but will put any actions in a combat turn at a -1. Default storage for a belt is 4 size of items.

### Backpack
Items stowed for longer storage using the support of your core. Bag items can be drawn/stowed as an action in combat. Default storage for a backpack is 6 size of items.

### Saddlebag
Storage bags using the strength of your horse. If you are with your horse, it will take a combat action to retrieve or stow to saddle bags. Default storage for saddlebags is 10 size of items.
