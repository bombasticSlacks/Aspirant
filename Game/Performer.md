#TODOcopy 

### Basic
#### Battle Music
If you have an [Simple Instrument](Example-Gear#Simple%20Instrument), or [Complex Instrument](Example-Gear#Complex%20Instrument) on you, every ally gets a +1 to initiative.

#### Busking
As [Skilled Work](Activities#Skilled%20Work), you can busk. Make a variable difficulty [Perform](Perform) skill test, you receive 2 silver per [Step Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success).

#### Come In Peace
Allies and yourself gain a +1 to social skill tests when interacting with residents of an area.

#### Contortionist
You can fit into impractically small spaces comfortably.

#### Heartthrob
Your character receives a +2 bonus to skill tests against people that are sexually attracted to you.

#### Lover Not A Fighter
You receive a +1 to all skill tests in situations where your life isn’t in danger, and you are not rushed. However, you receive a -1 to all skill tests while in combat.

#### Tumbling
As skilled work, you can do acrobatic routines / dance. Make a [Variable Difficulty](Skills#Variable%20Difficulty) [Acrobatics](Acrobatics) skill test, you receive 2 silver per [Step Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success).

#### Tinge Of Truth
After successfully lying to a person about something, you may spend influence to make it true or at least partially true. The GM should attempt to make this the case or give you a reasonable cost.

#### White Lie
You don’t need to roll [Perform](Perform) to lie about small, insignificant things.

#### Writer Of History
When an ally would be assigned a nickname, or a legend would be written, you can influence how it is recorded.

#### Second Identity
You have a second identity which you can assume at any time. While pretending to be this person, you don’t need to make fib tests about their life.

### Advanced

#### Editorializing
Once per downtime, if they are willing, you may give any character a single re-roll for any dice roll.

#### Performance Of Glory
#TODOcopy 
You may, as an action in combat, perform on your instrument to provide bonuses to allies. The difficulty of this test will vary based on the bonus you want to provide.

#### Understudy
During [Socialize](Activities#Socialize), you can select a training that another member of your party has, which you count as having until your next [Resting](Telling-The-Story#Resting), or [Socialize](Activities#Socialize).

#### What I Meant Was
Spend 2 [Power](Stats#Power) during narrative time, after speaking to someone and hearing how they react, you may say “what I meant to say was…” and the original reaction will be forgotten with the conversation continuing as if it didn’t happen.

### Master

#### Perform As The Legends
