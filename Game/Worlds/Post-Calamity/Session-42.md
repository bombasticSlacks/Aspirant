## Session 42
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* [[Argent-Hold#Commander Vasco]] wants them gone, might break out a fight or send assassins / wet work guys after them.
* [[Argent-Hold#Commander Jeremia Ashmane]] Could be convinced. Needs proof of whats happening thats more concrete than rumors. 
* [[Argent-Hold#Commander Alexis]] Approves of whats been going on, if the team is stuck on what to do for Ashmane there is a group hunting a powerful beast to the south.
* For the void, put them on a 7x7 grid, and have them roll to get details about squares. They can move around to find each other. All in Alexanders head, test to see if he can hold onto the people around him.
* Still push them with horror and will based skill dealing as they move closer. Maybe have a beast still alive near the pit. its corpse lashes out at them. A living void that remembers battles and fighters would be good.
* 
## Argent Hold 27th- Spring 
* Going to the smaller tower (seal) to investigate the nothing.
* Simple is gonna push his sis to get some people to help travel into the nothing.
* 28th
	* Diamond X will meet on the 29th.
	* The spire is a place of torture and vile magic. Normal rooms bottom half, bedrooms and madness second half.
	* X is obsessed with runes and words. 
	* 5 words for "beasts" of the world. Apocalyptic beasts. 
	* 1 beast is in the nothing, others elsewhere. The beast is being digested in the nothing.
