## Session 41
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* [[Argent-Hold#Commander Vasco]] wants them gone, might break out a fight or send assassins / wet work guys after them.
* [[Argent-Hold#Commander Jeremia Ashmane]] Could be convinced. Needs proof of whats happening thats more concrete than rumors. 
* [[Argent-Hold#Commander Alexis]] Approves of whats been going on, if the team is stuck on what to do for Ashmane there is a group hunting a powerful beast to the south.
* For the void, put them on a 7x7 grid, and have them roll to get details about squares. They can move around to find each other. All in Alexanders head, test to see if he can hold onto the people around him.
* Still push them with horror and will based skill dealing as they move closer. Maybe have a beast still alive near the pit. its corpse lashes out at them. A living void that remembers battles and fighters would be good.
