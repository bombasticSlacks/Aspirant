### Notes
*General Notes about the world*

  
Snowcrest to the North, The Crest Fallen people, a gaunt, militaristic group to the North. No last names, were exiled, however families have a “crest” which represents their in group.

  
  

Fallen Empire, Romanesque 200 years in the past, was magic the cause?

Archeotechnology, tried to marry magic and technology, arcane atom bomb went off destroyed the empire itself.

  
  

Roadside picnic style magic chaos zone in the centre of the continent, separating groups and disrupting travel. Ground zero is potentially beside us on the continent, the whole game takes place in a corner of that empire. Great reason to avoid external influence. 

  

Scared of wizards and machines, any progress might bring back to calamity.

  

Aristocracy of Vampires, literal human cattle. Wealthy courts of vampires powerful, dangerous to travel near. Necromancers.

  

The foil to this group is a scarlet crusader group, not good guys, witch hunters and reactionaries.

  

Banality ludidic faction “when we reached beyond we were slapped by God”.

  

Many ruins, decrepit towers, and caverns filled with tomes, texts, and schematics.

  

Powerful merchants on the coast, have remnants of the military and their tech, as well as the only remaining magic guild.

  

[Alexander-Aurelius](Alexander-Aurelius), from a central crossroads city, should be wealthy but pulled and stretched by all sides.

His hand has been replaced with a shadow but marked as celestial.” Stanton's goal to find the gauntlet relic that will give him the power. Pompous but caring, knows he’s destined, but believes he will provide for others. Questing for:

- Powerful allies
    
- Acquire the power to be the emperor (clothes, resolve the issues, etc.)
    
- Wants to walk the land (Christ style ✞)
