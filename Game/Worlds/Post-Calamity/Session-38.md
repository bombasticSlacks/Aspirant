## Session 38
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas

## Crosshaven 19th of Spring -
* For next time at the Lunastrella, and the Zinatu. 
* Arrived at camp, zinatu and argent hold tents. Including one with a mage.
	* Argent detatchment ran by [[Argent-Hold#Tally (Talia Defferen]])
	* [[Zinatu#Maria Archer Sign (she/her]]) tent is present as well
* Simple + Vespin going to Argent
	* Is nephew of simple
	* Sister is back home getting a troup to redeploy to some unknown problem. 
	* Simple is going to get her a letter.
* Everyone else going to Zinatu
	* Maria, Ande, and [[Zinatu#Sont Cancer Sign (they/them]]).
	* Maria thinks tower was always a weapon, Ande thinks it was repurposed.
	* The Lunar prepared the wizards tower as a weapon of mutual destruction. 
	* Last entry in the journal says either "they have returned from the stars", "he is back".
		* Ande thinks its a God to these people. 
	* Zinatu plan to set up a permanent camp at the wizard tower (with supervision) and do ecological research.
	* The Lustrum has less population because of tower.
	* They think that if anyone can survive in the west it is Alexander. 
	* Ande unlocked the expert level lunar training.
	* TODO next time,
		* Arturas wants to look at the tower
		* Simple writes a letter
		* Feast in the Camp
		* ONWARDS.
