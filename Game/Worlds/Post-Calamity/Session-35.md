## Session 35
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* Have to mix certain pedigrees of blood to move forward.
* The central blockade to get in to the staff requires blood of every type.
* Need to activate a device which will empower the staff. While its happening terrible blood magic events will happen.
	* Mind control, but the character fights a blood avatar and if they lose they act against their allies.
	* Exertion and then harm if they fight. Blood sickness which can be letted or otherwise cured / disrupted.
* The building will be full of wights and undead underlings. Leaving them and backtracking will create larger homunculi.
* There will be a vial of the old blood within the crypt, can use it orâ€¦ another vampires. 
* Big Cathedral above the crypt with zombies patrolling.
