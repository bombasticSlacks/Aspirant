# The Holy Order
The Holy Order Of Saint Lucian

Fanatical heretic hunters and anti-magic religious order.

Currently engaging in a crusade.

Paladins with golden platemail and great swords, very Reynald.
## Saint Lucian
Well renown figure of heroism and myth. The church idolizes him.

*What did he do, though?*


## Reliquary
Have a collection of relics they use as holy power, would never say they were magic.

## Miracles and Prayers
Have powerful magical abilities locked up in prayer and miracles from Saint Lucian.

### Inquisitors
* Inquistors are very 40k, can be absolutist but may also be open to other ideas.
