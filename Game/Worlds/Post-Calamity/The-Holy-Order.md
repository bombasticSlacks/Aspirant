## The Holy Order
The Holy Order Of Saint Lucian

Fanatical heretic hunters and anti-magic religious order.

Currently engaging in a crusade.

### Saint Lucian
Well renown figure of heroism and myth. The church idolizes him.

*What did he do, though?*


### Reliquary
Have a collection of relics they use as holy power, would never say they were magic.

### Miracles and Prayers
Have powerful magical abilities locked up in prayer and miracles from Saint Lucian.
