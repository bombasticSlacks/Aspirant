## Session 25
[Post-Calamity](Post-Calamity)

## Ideas
* Spirits of the dead in the burial cavern to the south that has been sealed for an eternity.
* Meet with a Captain Talson to potentialy get info and get access to the site which is otherwise blocked by the city.
* There is contention with the Church over what to do with the site. They think it is an abomination and should be destroyed. This is led by Cardinal Aolfi, some members of the Government also want the problem dealt with as well. City has it on lockdown though.
* There have been murders similarly.
* Need a book / lore to prove that the site didn't have religous significance. Predates the religion. 
* Minotaur in the Catacombs, a riddling master.
* *"I donâ€™t have eyes, But once I did see. I once had thoughts, Now white and empty."*
## Calphion 09 Winter -
* Calphion militia have blockaded the bay, we will start there next time. 
* Made it into the city, were stopped and informed of quarantine, given passes for 36 hours.
* Told to go see the church to handle stuff.
* Know of the quarantine,
* Greg found some spectral thugs attacking a woman, knows they are undead.
* They took them down.
* Went to the Church, met [Ignis Lux](Game/Worlds/Post-Calamity/Alexander-Aurelius#Ignis%20Lux) Inquisitor Lux. 
* The woman from the attack offered to have wife fix their armour for free. 
* Lux is the highest ranking member of the Calphion church normally. Otherwise covered by small time priests.
