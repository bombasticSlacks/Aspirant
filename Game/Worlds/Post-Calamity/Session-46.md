## Session 46
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* Hydra in the basement of the lustrum, a series of winding tunnels where horrifying visions strike. 
	* Worshipers of the hydra will have snake like eyes as a mutation. 
	* There leader is an archon and a powerful one. Korant.
	* Hydra attacks in the tunnels,
	* Thraals attack them in a large area like a greek coliseum temple
	* maybe some angler fish style stuff
	* Korant will be a magic user focusing on disruption and chaos.
* The monastery to the north is Sunspeak Monastery
	* A location in the north where pilgrims who have forsaken their past lives worship a living lunar celestial.
	* Will be afraid of Alexander will be afraid of his presence.
	* Will have real history for the party.
	* The pilgrims travel to the peak every morning to see the sun.
	* The sun celestial will have their old equipment still which they may give away. (Armour of the moon which repairs in the dark and a crescent staff which does the dnd spell jon likes lol)
* The ruins on the island are an ancient place of worship and celebration for seafarers. A number of crashed ships create a collection of ruins and remains. Haunted by ghosts of fallen seafarers. Relics and treasure are somewhere inside. (revolver, silvering cutlass that prints money a proper cannon the guys can stick on the car?)
## Lustrum 15th -  Summer 
* Kant met the party and mentioned Korant and his cultists
	* Cultists are at least a dozen (if not eaten) + hydra which is REAL big.
	* Mentions Snow Giants migrating far south. Its at least 6 (2 adults and 4+ children) they are people eaters and greedy. 
	* Iron Ladies are: Going to wait just south of the monastery, need to travel 5 days and will wait up to 5 days for the party. So have until the 21st. 
* THEY MADE THE FLYING CAR
* Next Time: HYDRA
* Made equipment, 
* Got Hydra details
* Moving through the wealthy district searching and sweeping, moving quietly, morty is scouting,
* 4 size of artisan stuff Alexander found as well as a small preserved collection of books 10 size of books and the bag to store them (camp upgrade).
* Angered a cultist carrying a ring, it started scream weezing the resonant frequency in the caves,
* Mortimer returned to Arturas and dropped the ring in his hand.
* For Next Time: The Hydra crashed through the walls near them bringing rocks around them and on them, it doesn't know they are there.
