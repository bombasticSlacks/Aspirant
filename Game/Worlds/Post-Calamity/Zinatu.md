## Ideas
### Soulbound
People who pass away may have their spirits bound to this plain, they exist in servitude if there will was weak, or exist as ascended beings if their will was strong. A huge motivation for all Zinatu is to gain the knowledge and capacity to ascend into something higher.

Soulbonding takes place at the Lustrum.
