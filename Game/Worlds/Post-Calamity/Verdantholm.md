### Roxy (Roxanne) la Croix
*clean well kept skin but tanned and calloused. Grey eyes and blonde / red hair. Wears banded plate / hood and carries a full blown service revolver (5 shots) and a cudgel.*
Was born the daughter of a minor merchant family in Verdantholm, but while she was still a child, her family was crushed by the plotting of one of the larger merchant groups. Her father was killed as a result of the schemes, leaving her to fend for her ailing mother and younger sibling on her own, with hardly a silver to their name. Her mother passed away after a few years of poverty, but she manages to provide for her sibling with the charisma you'd expect from the daughter of a merchant family, and the newfound guile and flexible morals necessitated by poverty. She eventually learns that her family's downfall was orchestrated by someone, however she has still yet to find out who. Once she learns this, her actions shifted from just survival to revenge, and she gradually took control of the loose connections between the thieves and other miscreants that were loosely referred to as the Exchange, shaping it into something more organized, with herself at the top. Under her leadership, some members realized that in a city of merchants and mages, gold and jewels were not the only prizes, and certain members of the Exchange steal and trade in information, a powerful commodity that allows them to survive despite the relative notoriety that has been accruing. From The Exchange headquarters, Roxy takes her revenge against the merchants of Verdantholm, still seeking the ones that lead her family to ruin.

## Locations
### The Exchange
Verdantholm is home to a large, powerful network of thieves, black market dealers, and wet work mercs.

The Exchange has many meeting sites across the city, where people can buy or sell illicit goods, or simple gathering places for ne'er-do-wells, often popping up out of nowhere and vanishing on the morrow, while the location of the headquarters is a closely guarded secret, presumed to be either somewhere underground or in one of the many inconspicuous buildings one can find in the harbor or downtown core.
