## Session 45
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* Hydra in the basement of the lustrum, a series of winding tunnels where horrifying visions strike. 
	* Worshipers of the hydra will have snake like eyes as a mutation. 
	* There leader is an archon and a powerful one. Korant.
* The monastery to the north is Sunspeak Monastery
	* A location in the north where pilgrims who have forsaken their past lives worship a living lunar celestial.
	* Will be afraid of Alexander will be afraid of his presence.
	* Will have real history for the party.
	* The pilgrims travel to the peak every morning to see the sun.
	* The sun celestial will have their old equipment still which they may give away. (Armour of the moon which repairs in the dark and a crescent staff which does the dnd spell jon likes lol)
* The ruins on the island are an ancient place of worship and celebration for seafarers. A number of crashed ships create a collection of ruins and remains. Haunted by ghosts of fallen seafarers. Relics and treasure are somewhere inside. (revolver, silvering cutlass that prints money a proper cannon the guys can stick on the car?)
