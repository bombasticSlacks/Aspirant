## Session 45
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* Hydra in the basement of the lustrum, a series of winding tunnels where horrifying visions strike. 
	* Worshipers of the hydra will have snake like eyes as a mutation. 
	* There leader is an archon and a powerful one. Korant.
* The monastery to the north is Sunspeak Monastery
	* A location in the north where pilgrims who have forsaken their past lives worship a living lunar celestial.
	* Will be afraid of Alexander will be afraid of his presence.
	* Will have real history for the party.
	* The pilgrims travel to the peak every morning to see the sun.
	* The sun celestial will have their old equipment still which they may give away. (Armour of the moon which repairs in the dark and a crescent staff which does the dnd spell jon likes lol)
* The ruins on the island are an ancient place of worship and celebration for seafarers. A number of crashed ships create a collection of ruins and remains. Haunted by ghosts of fallen seafarers. Relics and treasure are somewhere inside. (revolver, silvering cutlass that prints money a proper cannon the guys can stick on the car?)
## Argent Hold 11th -  Summer 
* For next time:
	* Planning to go North, 
	* Gonna ask spear ladies to help find the hunters I think
* Travelling in procession with Captain Brellen. 
* Traveling to Lustrum through the portal 15th of summer
	* Simple is Training (smite) and Mainting
	* Arturas is Craftin (Travelers Bag)
	* Greg is trainer (lady of Iron)
	* Alexander is experimenting w. the glove
		* Mostly a weapon of mass destruction, does control anti-magic
		* If Alexander does want, can lean to harness anti-magic, it would be a mini training tree.
		* Alexander feels that the glove attaching to him is only because of his heritage, it isn't part of his destiny.
* Hans and Gretta two young, brother and sister who join the procession to the north with the Argent Hold. Hans and Greta learn from Simpe field dressing and drills.
* The Captain mentions that pirates cover is the ruins to the north
* Kant met the party and mentioned Korant and his cultists
	* Cultists are at least a dozen (if not eaten) + hydra which is REAL big.
	* Mentions Snow Giants migrating far south. Its at least 6 (2 adults and 4+ children) they are people eaters and greedy. 
	* Iron Ladies are: Going to wait just south of the monastery, need to travel 5 days and will wait up to 5 days for the party. So have until the 21st. 
* THEY MADE THE FLYING CAR
* Next Time: HYDRA
