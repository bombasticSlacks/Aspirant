## Session 27
[Post-Calamity](Post-Calamity)

## Ideas
* Once entering catacombs there will be a large area with a huge spirit / zombie population (those that were burried with the king pharo style)
* When they push in further there will be lore rooms and a resting spot.
* The Catacombs housed different castes of people.
	* Workers - Need to move a large portion of water from one area to another with the labourers. Whipings, heat, hunger.
	* Soldiers - Need to defeat the beasts and machines that exist in the wilds.
	* Church Figures - Need to harness the power of light to reflect a disco ball.
* For the duration there will be spirits attempting to harm them and drain their sanity(?).
* Need to gain each groups trust to drop the barrier and allow passage to the kings chamber. 
## Calphion 10 Winter - 12 Winter
* 
* Next time: Talking to Shipyard owner and Diatona people, Vespin is recovering.
* Talked to dockmaster, got a crate with a magic belt.
* Ran through the city to the diatona,
* were let into the Diatona, it is blockaded heavily.
* Ran into an event on the way to the Church.
	* 10 Task masters Plate armour and barbed whips, 50 servants. 
	* The Tyrant King of the old city, used his people as a labour force to build an ancient site / burial site.
* Made it to the diatona with the reps
