## Session 47
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* Hydra in the basement of the lustrum, a series of winding tunnels where horrifying visions strike. 
	* Worshipers of the hydra will have snake like eyes as a mutation. 
	* There leader is an archon and a powerful one. Korant.
	* Hydra attacks in the tunnels,
	* Thraals attack them in a large area like a greek coliseum temple
	* maybe some angler fish style stuff
	* Korant will be a magic user focusing on disruption and chaos.
* The monastery to the north is Sunspeak Monastery
	* A location in the north where pilgrims who have forsaken their past lives worship a living lunar celestial.
	* Will be afraid of Alexander will be afraid of his presence.
	* Will have real history for the party.
	* The pilgrims travel to the peak every morning to see the sun.
	* The sun celestial will have their old equipment still which they may give away. (Armour of the moon which repairs in the dark and a crescent staff which does the dnd spell jon likes lol)
* The ruins on the island are an ancient place of worship and celebration for seafarers. A number of crashed ships create a collection of ruins and remains. Haunted by ghosts of fallen seafarers. Relics and treasure are somewhere inside. (revolver, silvering cutlass that prints money a proper cannon the guys can stick on the car?)
## Lustrum 15th -  Summer 
* For Next Time: The Hydra crashed through the walls near them bringing rocks around them and on them, it doesn't know they are there. 
* Arturas and Simple and Ignis on F1 North,
* Greg and Alexander on F2 North, Greg grabbed Alexander
* Everyone took some damage and got out of the building they were in.
* Ring mortimer nabbed was a nice ring of a guildsman.
* remember Greg can talk to animals. 
* Thraal is moving back and got blown up.
* Hydra showed up and they managed to keep it there to kill it.
* Greg was splashed with the ooze from the Hydra, but Simple cured him.
* Got to the sanctum, there was a puzzle to put something in basins to open the door. Moon cycles on a basin. 
* Lunar energy splashes them with 2 cold damage. 
* Simple figured out how to open the door.
* In the distance a collection of aesthetic pillars and a large pile of glistening goodies.

### To Do

* [[Verdantholm#Roxy (Roxanne) la Croix]] will think on who would make a good leader of the merchants.
* Reverse segment danger text
* Look at the healer kit, give it +1 after roll and make it so it can't clear injuries, or only sometimes(?)
* Cooking Kit for cooking food and stuff.
* Update headings on the Storage stuff, 1 list with 2 checkboxes, 
* Subtle trait for bags
* Flying Car Stats (Can ignore travel encounter, usually can see it and go down tho) narrative ignore 
* Fix rogue and some other stuff that applies minuses to actions becoming +'s to defend. 
* Healer make it less "surgery" themed, and just healing themed. Make it cure illness and other problems. 
* Bring back initiative but NO rolling.
* Move to a DC description for penalties to make it more obvious what players are rolling / doing. 

### Hooks
* the maiden of iron at the Iron Lady is an ancient earthbound saint who had a tower shield said to be impervious. 
* Tower of Saint Lucian fighting mega beasts of the Umbral Courts in battle. Umbral courts have better weapons and armour than they have in the past.
* Less demon sightings in the North East, people have been vanishing that go into The Glade. 
*
