## Session 21
[Post-Calamity](Post-Calamity)

## Ideas
* Woodland Fairy Settlement [Gladepool](Game/Worlds/Post-Calamity/Gladepool)
* The mechanical creature will be a dungeon with traps and issues:
	* Excavating out a doorway / finding a way in.
	* Identifying the source of the illness.
	* Navigating to the head to find more information on the battle and potentially a reward in the cockpit.
	* Noxious gas (a bioweapon) will be lingering in the cockpit.
* The creatures nearby will be warped and vile which will require defeating or avoiding.
* The fairies will be able to cure the bioweapon for a price (a memory).
* Potential tie-in for Vespin and losing his memories.
## Verdantholm 23 Fall - 28 Fall
* Met Keddy, calls Alexander "the pale one".
* Moved through the woods, survived the trials.
* Made it to oldy, mentioned the large mecha, being older than the forest.
