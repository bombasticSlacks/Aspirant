## Session 32
[Post-Calamity](Post-Calamity)

## Ideas
* Zinatu camp
	* about a dozen people + [Soulbound](Game/Worlds/Post-Calamity/Zinatu#Soulbound) workin at the camp
	* Will be preparing to leave as the issues have completed from nearby
	* Will be splitting up, some community is going north towards the Lunastrella a new device which is under partial Hedgemony watch but they hope to study.
	* Some going to the south towards Chordys to resupply and gain materials. They have heard whisperings of an arcane infused beast to the south east and a cursed mansion to the south west. 
* Manour
	* mostly looted and ransacked maybe some stuff around if they look hard
	* Basement will be sealed (secret) with cool stuff behind it. Need to use Wolfsbite to unlock it.
	* **Computare** a lost living computer in the basement of the building can answer questions of deep importance. The remains of a celestial earthbound pinned to a chair and powered by lightning. 
	* Computare will have completed the plans for the hoarfrost upgrade to wolfsbite.
	* Rewards in the basement, 
		* the matter reconstituter - can be used during travel to transform an object into something of a higher tier and a different type. Needs to be powered.
		* Hoarfrost parts.
		* The celestial abilities book. Needs translation, advanced trainings are missing.
		* Wolfs Armour Plans, set of armour that is fueled by blood of injured enemies. Partialy complete
			* 10 integrity, no negatives penalties, no weakness, no resistance. Need to finish the living metal and run blood ducts.
		* Masters Tool Kit Size 1 Tinkerers Kit.
	* Basement layout
		* A long hall leading to a bone yard with the bones of lots of creatures, three rooms past it,
			* Comp room (locked)
			* Forbidden library (has the key to comp room)
			* Forbidden workshop
