## Session 43
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* Beast still alive near the pit.
* Find a corpse that is untouched. It will have created a barrier. Will have a sword, all the magic will be sapped out, but it will be an incredible make. Earth bound. Its memories overwhelm when close. 
* Corpse wakes when close, near the glove too.
## Argent Hold 27th- Spring 
* Made it into the nothing,
