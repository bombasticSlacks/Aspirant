## Session 11
[Post-Calamity](Post-Calamity)
## Segment 11 Tussole Summer 5-6
* Moving through the darkness, not sure what their current heading should be.
* Can't push through the trees, couldn't determine a heading for thicker or thinner woods.
* Got attacked by some earth elementals, Greg got hurt.
* Found signs of a Cyclops.
* Skirted past a megafauna drawn to the light.
* Destroyed the [Heart Tree](#Heart%20Knot).
* Simple is taking notes on the state of the skirmish and the dead.
* Saw the Rot Titan, 60-75 feet tall an amalgam of rot, wood and vine, moving along like a moving mass connecting and moving to everything nearby. It has something embedded in the middle. A celestial dowel shaped item about 6ft tall.
* Found small efigies of rot and twig, someone is lining the barrier with.
* Think it was [Jock Tennens](Tennens-Settlement#Jock%20Tennens) and perhaps the root of his power.
* Reached out to [Darla "Cross" Tennens](Tennens-Settlement#Darla%20"Cross"%20Tennens), 
	* mentioned the idols they planted to release the elemental. Thinks Jock wants to release it.
	* Wants her help, want to get both settlements to help seal it further, remove the thorn, have it decay over time.
	* There is a field called Passover where the groups can meet to broker peace.
