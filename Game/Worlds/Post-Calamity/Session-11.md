* Destroyed the [[#Heart Knot|Heart Tree]].
* Simple is taking notes on the state of the skirmish and the dead.
* Saw the Rot Titan, 60-75 feet tall an amalgam of rot, wood and vine, moving along like a moving mass connecting and moving to everything nearby. It has something embedded in the middle. A celestial dowel shaped item about 6ft tall.
* Found small efigies of rot and twig, someone is lining the barrier with.
* Think it was [[Tennens-Settlement#Jock Tennens]] and perhaps the root of his power.
* Reached out to [[Tennens-Settlement#Darla "Cross" Tennens]], 
	* mentioned the idols they planted to release the elemental. Thinks Jock wants to release it.
