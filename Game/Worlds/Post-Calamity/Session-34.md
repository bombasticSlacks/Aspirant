## Session 34
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* Have to mix certain pedigrees of blood to move forward.
* The central blockade to get in to the staff requires blood of every type.
* Need to activate a device which will empower the staff. While its happening terrible blood magic events will happen.
	* Mind control, but the character fights a blood avatar and if they lose they act against their allies.
	* Exertion and then harm if they fight. Blood sickness which can be letted or otherwise cured / disrupted.
* The building will be full of wights and undead underlings. Leaving them and backtracking will create larger homunculi.
* There will be a vial of the old blood within the crypt, can use it or… another vampires. 
* Big Cathedral above the crypt with zombies patrolling.
## Blood Temple 8th Spring
* At the crypt with the staff of power.
* Vespin detected that the church has evil ancient magic and living dead in the basement.
* Old church with reinforced doors, few pews remain at the front, portraits and art depict vampire aristocracy. Door moves to the upstairs, and to the basement.
* Blood basin well used with dried blood, some fresh blood is in it currently.
* Alexander mixed his blood with that in the bowl and it changed color towards white. 
* Basin Puzzle
	* Vespin added his blood (Outsider, Blood, Lunar, 
	* Akren tried the bowl, nothing happened
	* Greg tried the bowl, it took more blood but was successful (Outsider, Blood, Lunar, Solar, )
	* Tried Jasmuta nothing
	* Tried Alexander again nothing
	* 
* Went to explore found a box with a vial of very old strain pure vampires blood.
* Back on Puzzle
	* Poured the vampire blood into the basin (1/2) of it
* SImple knows a vampire prayers similar to the prayers of the carrion vampires.
* Vespin knows a prayer the crimson vampires pray when giving blood offering to their superiors.
* Back on Puzzle
	* Ignis gonna try, from Argent Hold originally.
	* Solved the puzzle
* Ignis explained vampires would never offer their own blood.
* Hypothesis about Greg being part solar.
* Explored into the crypt, killed some vampire spawn 
* When they double back the spawn have grown back into larger masses of flesh.
* For NEXT TIME
	* Dealing with the corpses.
	* Exploring the left side.
