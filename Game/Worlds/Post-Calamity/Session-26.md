## Session 26
[Post-Calamity](Post-Calamity)

## Ideas
* Spirits of the dead in the burial cavern to the south that has been sealed for an eternity.
* There is contention with the City over what to do with the site. Church think it is an abomination and should be destroyed. This is led by Cardinal Aolfi, 
* Some members of the Government also want the problem dealt with as well. City has it on lockdown though. Meet with a Captain Talson to potentialy get info and get access to the site which is otherwise blocked by the city. 
* There have been murders similarly.
* Need a book / lore to prove that the site didn't have religous significance. Predates the religion. 
* Minotaur in the Catacombs, a riddling master.
* *"I don’t have eyes, But once I did see. I once had thoughts, Now white and empty."*
