## Session 28
[[Post-Calamity]]

## Ideas
* Once entering catacombs there will be a large area with a huge spirit / zombie population (those that were burried with the king pharo style)
* When they push in further there will be lore rooms and a resting spot. 2 size of exotic metal, 4 size of artisan spirits, 5 size of exotic cloth.
* The Catacombs housed different castes of people.
	* Workers - Need to find it in the atrium behind them as they push through (unless they somehow find it. )
	* Soldiers - Need to sneak past the unholy guards that patrol the area. If they fail the room will begin to fill with darkness, volition or damage. Room will have some weapons of unique design. Some spring spears in this room.
	* Church Figures - Need to show devotion, know the prayer of the Lord or be attacked with light and energy. (can be found in the chroniclers room). A book of holy ordaining which you can spend a power to give someone a (+2) on a volition test in this room (you always have the bonus while holding this).
* For the duration there will be spirits attempting to harm them and drain their sanity(?).
* Need to gain each groups insignia to make it to the inner chamber. 
* Lord Of The Dead boss fight
	* Dark Staff, Shadow Topper (marks people with darkness, can detonate corpses?) 5(-1), Impact, Penetrating.
	* Damned Crown - Can speak to the dead, see the dead(?)
## Calphion 12 Winter -
* They took the book
* Alexander talking to Francis (the lore keeper) about other tomes and history. They said they needed more permission to view more. Spoke of a King Of The Dead that founded this area, a minor diety who was potetially suppressed by the celestials. Kings story ends abruptly with a "regime change". Most of the lore from the post king era was destroyed as blasphemous.
