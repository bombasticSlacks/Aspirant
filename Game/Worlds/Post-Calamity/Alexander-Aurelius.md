## Alexander Aurelius
from a central crossroads city, should be wealthy but pulled and stretched by all sides. Minor noble, big draw, adopted not sure where he came from. Found and raised by nobles. Dreams “sees himself sitting on a throne surrounded by shadows, including childhood friend [Greg-Colter](Greg-Colter).” sees them as advisors. “Sees a flag, adorned with a celestial emblem, waving across the land. His hand has been replaced with a shadow but marked as celestial.” Stanton's goal to find the gauntlet relic that will give him the power.
