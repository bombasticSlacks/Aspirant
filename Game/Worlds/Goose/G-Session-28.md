# Session 28
## Ideas
* Heading south to deal with the cultists, will have encampments and attacks along the way and other stuff.
* More Effigies
* Magical blockade created by a wizard of the cult. 
* A spy or more must exist in the cities ranks.
* Strong Frontal Blockade with magical forcefield.
* The Other Two apocalypse creatures have been summoned (find out from the mage).

## Year 1332 Spring 19th - 24th
* FOR NEXT TIME:
	* Arriving at the FoB, where they will plan the last assault.
	* A frontal force.
	* Need to deal with 3 things, 
		* there are cultists powering effigy soldiers.
		* Some form of dark energy that doesn't seem good.
		* A lock on the main entrance to the city that soldiers haven't been able to make heads or tails of yet. 
* [Corporal Gezz](Game/Worlds/Goose/Mornhold.md#Corporal%20Gezz), [Dres Snider (She/Her)](Game/Worlds/Goose/Mornhold.md#Dres%20Snider%20(She/Her)), [Lord Zin Head of the Mage Knights](Game/Worlds/Goose/Mornhold.md#Lord%20Zin%20Head%20of%20the%20Mage%20Knights) 
* **THE PLAN**
	* Elves are attacking the effigy cultists
	* Mercs and mages are battling on the front on the south side
	* Gez and company are going to shoot FUCKING ZOMBIES into the city via catapult.
	* Rei + Casey are gonna slip through gate while disguised to disable the gate
	* Bront + Mal + Zin 
* **Riddle:** Walk over me and you're somewhere new, I'm the line between old and new. What am I?  
* **Answer**: _Threshold_
* Defeated the dragon, Bront + Mal hold up in a building
* Casey escaped the cultists that were chasing them, going to collect the zombies. 
* Rei is out on the front lines gonna meet up w. Stem and fight on the front as a dragon.
*
