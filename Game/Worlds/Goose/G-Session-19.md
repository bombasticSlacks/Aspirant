# Session 19
## Ideas
* Sun palace 
	* Lenses mirror room, focusing light into one of three optional areas. Each one gives a light towards a central opening.
		* Main room was once a lab, but seems to have been turned for the most part to dust, there will be the remains of a ritual. 
		* One is a boiler room with steam elementals in the pipes
		* One is a bedroom with multiple objects covered in sheets (some are dangerous / explode, only one is a focusing lens).
		* Storage room, you just need to find the lens but being in the tower causes heat and exaustion. 
	* Palace is inverted as you walk in gravity shifts backwards. The heavy gravity puts avoiding at a (-1).
	* Final room has a Solar Demon in it.

## Year 1332 Winter 25th -
