## To Do
* Stem sent a message to Rigor
* Mal gonna brainstorm some pre-sets for armour.
First armor design I want is subtle living armor made of exotic metal and leather. This is the base state my armor exists in and looks like normal clothes. Second armor design is combat armor that is warded and tempered. Exotic Metal and machinery. This looks like platemail that is constantly reworking it's own construction with gems radiating dim magickal looking light surfacing at random as the overlapping plates rearrange.  
Third armor looks like vines and foliage from the pale elf forest made of exotic wood and textiles and it has the traits sealed and regenerating. It slowly over the course of an hour or so cycles through all four seasons of the year. Let me know if any of these need to work differently.    
Let me know if you'd like me to go into greater detail on what they look like when I expend a power to make them masterwork for a scene. I'm hoping that if I make the first armor masterwork the only change is that it becomes dazzling clothing.
For my first shaped weapon I want a handless pulling weapon that literally appears that my belt transforms into a liquid metal snake that strikes at nearby foes and on a successful attack performs a pull attack after dealing damage. (edited)
Second shaped weapon is an ensnaring lingering club. That has thorny vinelike emplacements along it that on a succesful strike grapple and then the thorns tear at the foe during the lingering effect.    
When the first is masterwork it becomes an area attack with however many serpents as are needed to hit every enemy in reach. When the second is masterwork it gains a long reach. (edited)
Third shaped weapon is a very threatening scythe that is sundering. When Masterwork it becomes eradicating.
