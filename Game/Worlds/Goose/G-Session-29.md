# Session 29
## Ideas
* Need to find the source of the madness. It'll be a reflective pit that focuses the red star.
* Even some soldiers are going crazy when they approach it. 
* Afterwards we will work on Epilogues and there will be potential rewards for the characters including promoting their station. 
* There will also be potential to get a meeting with [[Court-Of-Queen-Sollen]] on the mayors airship. 
* Cantor and Marcelle are also now heading north with the passage open.
	* Mal - Dagger that can kill anything will be slipped to him if he goes for the meeting. / elves and mage knights will offer him a place as they return.
	* Casey - Darcellus will want them back and bring a private boat to potentially pick them up.
	* Stem - Will get a calling that somewhere dead have been awoken in the north with the shift of magic.
	* Rei - Drez will ask them if they want to travel with them, see places and people of interest. 
	* Bront - Aunt will offer to take him home.

## Year 1332 Spring 19th - 24th
* For next time:
	* Defeated the dragon, Bront + Mal hold up in a building
	* Casey escaped the cultists that were chasing them, going to collect the zombies. 
	* Rei is out on the front lines gonna meet up w. Stem and fight on the front as a dragon.
* Marcelle + Drez + Zin + Mercs (8) + team moving to the final place of power. 
* Stem gonna write a letter to rigor.
* Bront sending letter to Bellend, the herbalist to come investigate the extra dimentional pit
* Casey got the remaining zombies and corpses. Packaging them up. 
* Mal writing a letter to family, celebrating.
* Rei just celebrating and getting drunk. Gonna write a play. 
* Choices:
	* Casey heading back to Darcellus.
	* Bront gonna set up at the ecological alien zone near bellend.  Gonna live in Bellend
	* Rei gonna be an author and perform in the south
	* Mal going to the heavens, has the blade of fate.
	* Stem is gonna take control of the Lens, become the owner of the tower and be a focal point of the Blue Dawn. Get an undead crew for the ship they obtained.
