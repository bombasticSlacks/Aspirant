## Year 1332 Spring 19th - 24th
* NEXT TIME:

* Killed the butcher
	* Dropped 2 cleavers, size 4, 5(-1) rending, with bound, any enemy killed by this becomes a thrall, can weild 1 handed if maddened. 
	* Hand Plate - Maddened, immune to mind effects. 
	* Broken Lantern - 2 size of exotic metal, 1 size of exotic cloth
