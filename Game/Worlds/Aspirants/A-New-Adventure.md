# A New Adventure
{: .no_toc }

Whenever you begin a new adventure in a new place you:
* Talk about what your characters been up to.
* Spend any available experience.
* [Follow A Thread](#Follow%20A%20Thread).
* Figure out [What's Been Going Wrong](#What's%20Been%20Going%20Wrong).


## Follow A Thread


## What's Been Going Wrong
Things never go right as you are making your way to a location. Roll on the table below to see what has recently happened. These effects are not static, it is possible for your character to suggest ways they potentially mitigated them. Any problems that haven't been resolved become threads you may follow.
