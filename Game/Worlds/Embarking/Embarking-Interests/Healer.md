#### Healer
*A healer of people and animals.*
* Begin play with additional ranks in [Application](Game/Core/Intelligence#Application), [Volition](Game/Core/Spirit#Volition).
* Begin play with a [Trauma Kit](Game/Example-Gear#Trauma%20Kit).

#### Heart Of The Healer
You may perform surgery on someone who has suffered lasting injuries to treat them. This action cannot be performed in combat and take a few minutes. 

Using a trauma kit, perform an [Application](Gear/Core/Intelligence#Application).
  A successful surgery removes the person's [Long Term Injury](Gear/Core/Effects#Long%20Term%20Injury). If you have access to any replacement body parts, or mostly intact severed limbs, they can be reapplied as part of surgery.

Surgery can only be attempted once, per person, per [Downtime](Gear/Telling-The-Story#Downtime).
