## Effects
Effects are temporary things that can be applied to a character. They will effect your [Action](Terminology#Action) and the [Action](Terminology#Action) of others.

### Stunned
A stunned character cannot perform [Action](Terminology#Action) or move.

### Unconscious
A character that can no longer fight is considered unconscious. This might consist of having to put pressure on wounds, being in shock, actually being unconscious, or any number of narrative appropriate scenarios. A character who is considered unconscious skips their [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn), and has a [Threat](Stats#Threat) of 0. They remain in this state until the end of combat, and potentially longer if narratively appropriate.
