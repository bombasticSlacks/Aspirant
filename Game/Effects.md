## Effects
Effects are temporary things that can be applied to a character. They will effect your [Action](Terminology#Action) and the [Action](Terminology#Action) of others.

### Stunned
A stunned character cannot perform [Action](Terminology#Action) or move.

### Unconscious
A character that can no longer fight is considered unconscious. This might consist of having to put pressure on wounds, being in shock, actually being unconscious, or any number of narrative appropriate scenarios. A character who is considered unconscious skips their [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn), and has a [Threat](Stats#Threat) of 0. They remain in this state until the end of combat, and potentially longer if narratively appropriate.

### On Fire
Your character or their clothing is currently burning. See [Being on Fire](Injury#Being%20on%20Fire) for more details.

### Prone
Your character is on the ground. They suffer a -2 to all [Strike](Strength#Strike) skill tests, cannot perform [Reaction](Terminology#Reaction).

To stop being prone in combat you perform a [Grace](Agility#Grace) [Fixed Difficulty(0)](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty):
* If you succeed you may stand as a [Free Action](Terminology#Free%20Action)
* If you fail you may stand as a [Free Action](Terminology#Free%20Action) but cannot move during this [Combat Round](Terminology#Combat%20Round)
