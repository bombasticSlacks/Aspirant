## Skills
Things your character can do. In general, if you don’t have any levels in a skill, you can’t attempt to make a skill test. If it seems possible, or you must make the test, you count your skill value as -2.

Skills range in value from 0-3
0 is untrained
1 is a beginner
2 is a professional
3 is an expert

### Types Of Skill Tests

Skill tests come in a few various types.
#### Variable Difficulty
This is a test where you will receive more information or success based on how well you do. An example is a knowledge test to know about a historical event; passing may constitute knowing the name and factions involved, whereas getting a 14+ might provide you with a full retelling. When talking about variable difficulties, rules may reference steps of success. A step is 1 additional on your dice roll, 4 steps of success is a “14”. 

#### Fixed Difficulty
A standard skill test, will have a negative assigned, and it will be either pass or fail.

#### Opposed Difficulty
A standard skill test, however since the skill test is directed at a certain thing it will influence the difficulty. An example would be trying to sneak past someone, which is opposed by their ranks in perception, meaning the test is at an additional negative equal to their skill ranks.

#### Aid and Hindrance
When multiple characters are all attempting to perform the same task together, instead of each rolling separately, the most skilled of the group rolls and receives a +1 for each person who is skilled and aiding them. Similarly, they receive a -1 for each person who isn’t trained and is part of the activity. So, if two trained doctors attempt first aid, the better makes a skill test with an additional +1. If 5 characters are attempting to sneak past a guard and 2 are trained and 3 are not, then the roll is at an additional -2 (+1, -3).
