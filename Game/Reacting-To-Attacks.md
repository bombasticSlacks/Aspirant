## Reacting to Attacks
During each full turn of combat, each character gets a single [Reaction](Terminology#Reaction), which they can use when something else happens during combat. 
* Your reaction refreshes on your turn. 
* In general, these are used to avoid incoming attacks. 
* You cannot spend a [Reaction](Terminology#Reaction) on your own [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) unless otherwise noted.
The generally available reactions are:

### Avoid
If an [Opponent](Terminology#Opponent) performs a [Successful Attack](Terminology#Successful%20Attack), you may perform a [Reflexes](Agility#Reflexes) [Fixed Difficulty](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(-2). If you succeed, you ignore the effects of the attack unless otherwise specified.

### Move to Cover
A [Grace](Agility#Grace) skill test where if you succeed then you may move to a piece of cover within [Reach](Movement#Reach) before an enemy ranged attack is calculated. You cannot Move to Cover while [Prone](Effects#Prone).

### Attack of Opportunity
If someone moves while [In Melee](Terminology#In%20Melee) with you, you may make an [Attack](Terminology#Attack) against them.

### All Out Attack
You may spend a [Reaction](Terminology#Reaction) on your [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) to get a (+2) to all [Action](Terminology#Action).
