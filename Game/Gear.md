## Gear
Generalist [[Equipment]] characters in the world of Aspirant need to perform activities and skill tests or otherwise help their characters. 

### Handling Equipment
Unless specified, gear should be handled narratively. Reliable gear that isn’t otherwise damaged or displaced can be reused, temporary things like torches usually can’t.

### Toolkits
Toolkits are a type of gear that abstracts a collection of tools necessary for a certain activity meaning a character doesn't need to be as concerned with tracking really specific items on their character sheet. This doesn't mean a character with a *specific* item can't do a skill test or action with a specific item that they've obtained narratively just that a tool kit would have made it much easier. Tool kits will either be called a "Tool Kit" or "Kit". 

In some cases Toolkits will have charges, these unless otherwise specified can be refreshed in any civilized settlement of size 2 or greater for the listed cost.
