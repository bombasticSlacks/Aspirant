## Comestibles
Comestible [Equipment](Equipment) consists of anything that the character will exhaust with use.

### Munitions
Some weapons with a [Capacity](Terminology#Capacity) will require munitions of some kind. 

### Ammunition
The simplest form of munition is ammunition. Basic ammunition costs 1 silver and has a size of $1 \over 5$ and allows you to deal the standard damage of [Weapons](Weapons) with a [Capacity](Terminology#Capacity).

Specialty ammunition exists however and could potentially influence [Damage Type](Weapons#Damage%20Type), add effects, or even increase or reduce [Damage Bonus](Weapons#Damage%20Bonus).

### Throwables
A less sophisticated solution to ranged attacks, sometimes weapons or items are designed to be thrown. A character can spend a [Combat Turn](Terminology#Combat%20Turn) finding a decent sized rock for throwing, these are size 1, have a [Damage Bonus](Weapons#Damage%20Bonus) of [Strength](Strength) and a damage type of [Impact](Injury#Impact).

As with [Ammunition](#Ammunition), specialized throwables exist either with larger damage bonuses, specialized effects or changed damage type.

### Salvaging
When you use munitions and don't succeed at the skill test, there is a 50% chance that the ammunition is salvageable. This can be calculated by rolling a d6, on a 1-3 the ammo is destroyed, on a 4-6 the ammo is lootable.
