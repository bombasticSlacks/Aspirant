## Clutter Items
Things character shouldn't be interested in buying to travel with but may be of use narratively should be treated as materials. 20ft of rope is equivalent to 2 size of cloth (based on quality), 10ft of chain is 2 size of metal, a steel cup is 1 size of metal, etc. these can be used in scenes but usually an adventurer is better suited using a properly packed kit of tools.
