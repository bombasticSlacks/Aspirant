### Basic
#### Armed To The Teeth
#TODOmigrate 
You can carry twice the consumables or ammo in the same amount of size on your belt. So, as an example, if 10 arrows are 2 size, you may carry 20 arrows as 2 size.

#### Cross Arm Block
You may spend a reaction to force an incoming attack to hit you in one of your arms. You do not get to further defend against the attack.

#### Head Down
#TODOmigrate 
If you move during your turn, enemies suffer a -2 to hit you with ranged attacks until your next turn.

#### Perfect Fit
Suits of armour you wear have 1 additional integrity.

#### Phalanx
When wielding a shield and in melee with an ally, you and allies you are in melee with get a +1 to make non-damaging melee skill tests.

#### Protector
When wielding a shield, you can spend reactions to protect another character you are in melee with.

#### Shield Expert
While using a weapon with the [Shield](Weapon-Traits#Shield) trait, it also provides the arm holding it, head, and torso with additional armour from ranged attacks. A standard shield has no weaknesses or resistances, and its armour integrity is 4. 

#### Steel Wall
While using a weapon with the [Shield](Weapon-Traits#Shield) trait, if you successfully mitigate an enemy attack, that enemy cannot perform attacks against you until your next turn.

#### Strapped
#TODOmigrate 
You get an additional 4 size worth of belt space.

#### Terminator
You cannot be forced to move or knocked over while wearing all metal armour.

### Advanced
#### Grand Defender

#### Heavy Hitter
#TODOmigrate 
While wearing all metal armour, you can parry and block using your arms and all of your attacks may knock back enemies STR meters.

#### Iron Curtain
If you have not made a melee attack in a round and are wielding a shield, you may parry as a free action as your turn ends.

#### Roll With The Punches
After suffering an injury, test STR with a -1 difficulty for a severe injury, -2 for critical and -3 for lethal. If you succeed, reduce the severity of the injury by one level.

#### Second Skin
