## Movement
In Aspirant, specifics of measurement, distance and the idea of "movement speed", are simplified. Instead of a movement speed, usually it is assumed your character can make it to where they want to go, the question is how rushed will you be when you get there.

### Distance Increments
Generally, when you are getting ready to do an action and plan to move towards something, there are 5 distances it can be from you:

#### Reach
The location is within reach.

#### Close
The location is nearby, basically anyone could make it there without too much trouble.

#### Short
The location is a short travel distance, it would be a challenge for most people to get there quickly. 

#### Far
The location is far off, even a very fast person would struggle to get to it quickly.

#### Impossible
The location isn't reachable in a timely manner. You should instead try to move towards it, but more narrative work needs to be done to get to it. 

As a [GM](How-To-Play#GM) try to avoid making situations and locations where things are impossible to reach. Impossible should also include suggestions for more approachable milestones.

#### Approximating Distance
Distances shouldn't be set in stone, it should be flexible based on your characters' movement and the timescale of the current events. However, the following guidelines are provided.

| Name       | Approximate Distance |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| [Reach](#Reach)      | $< 3m$               |
| [Close](#Close)      | $\approx 10m$        |
| [Short](#Short)      | $\approx 20m$        |
| [Far](#Far)        | $\approx 40m$        |
| [Impossible](#Impossible) | $> 50m$              |

### Movement Action Penalty
When you are expected to travel to a location and immediately perform an action, like when in [Combat](Combat), or otherwise pressured, any action you take may be at a penalty based on your [Movement Distance](Stats#Movement%20Distance). 

Your movement action penalty is equal to the number of additional distance increments you need to travel beyond your [Movement Distance](Stats#Movement%20Distance).

> So if you had 2 [Agility](Agility) your [Movement Distance](Stats#Movement%20Distance) is [Reach](#Reach), if you were to move [Close](#Close) you would suffer a (-1) to an action, [Far](#Far) would be a (-3).

There is no movement action penalty for [Impossible](#Impossible) because it isn't possible to arrive there. The character must spend some time in transit before making it, any action penalty would be based on their intermediate destination.
