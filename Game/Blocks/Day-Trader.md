*Money is always moving and exchanging hands. You move it around with ease.*
* [[Handling-Equipment#Currency]] has no [[Handling-Equipment#Size]] for you and your [[Terminology#Ally]], and is considered weightless.
* [[Handling-Equipment#Currency]] is never physically on you or your [[Terminology#Ally]] person, thus it cannot be stolen, inspected, confiscated, etc.
