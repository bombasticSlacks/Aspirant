### Weapon Smithing

As [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work), using a [Armourers Tool Set](Example-Gear#Armourers%20Tool%20Set) you can use [Application](Core/Intelligence#Application) to craft [Basic](Designing-Weapons#Basic) and [Artisan](Designing-Weapons#Artisan) weapons, more details are available in [Designing-Weapons](Designing-Weapons).

You can also as [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work) craft [Munitions](Core/Comestibles#Munitions) using [Application](Core/Intelligence#Application). This costs half the price as the ammo normally would, and you can create up to 10 per [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work).
