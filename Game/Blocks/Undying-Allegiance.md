### Undying Allegiance
*Your allies are willing to protect you, your leadership inspires faith.*
* You may opt to have an [[Terminology#Ally]] in [[Movement#Reach]] be the target of any [[Terminology#Attack]], that isn't already targeting them, instead of you.
* Your [[Terminology#Ally]] never die outright from [[Injury#Injury Damage]] they are instead knocked [[Effects#Unconscious]].
* You may **command** to: As a [[Reaction]] all [[Reacting#Avoid]] a multi target attack (everyone still performs [[Terminology#Skill Test]] separately).
