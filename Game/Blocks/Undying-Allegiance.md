### Undying Allegiance
*Your allies are willing to protect you, your leadership inspires faith.*
* You may opt to have an [Ally](Game/Core/Terminology#Ally) in [Reach](Game/Core/Movement#Reach) be the target of any [Attack](Game/Core/Terminology#Attack), that isn't already targeting them, instead of you.
* Your [Allies](Game/Core/Terminology#Ally) never die outright from [Injury Damage](Game/Core/Injury#Injury%20Damage) they are instead knocked [Unconscious](Game/Core/Effects#Unconscious).
* You may **command** to: As a [Reaction](Game/Core/Blocks/Reaction) all [Avoid](Game/Core/Reacting#Avoid) a multi target attack (everyone still performs [Skill Test](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test) separately).
