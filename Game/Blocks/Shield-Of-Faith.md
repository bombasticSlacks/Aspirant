### Shield Of Faith
*Your faith is iron, and protects you from harm.*
* You can have 1 additional **faith**.
* When you suffer a [[Terminology#Successful Attack]] gain a **faith**.
* Any time you take [[Terminology#Damage]] you may spend **faith** to reduce the [[Terminology#Damage]] by 1 per **faith** spent.
