### Wild Wits
*You retain your wits, even when transformed.*
* When you are [Transformed](Game/Core/Effects#Transformed) you can still perform [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) using your [Skills](Game/Core/Skills). If you have an appropriate number of manipulators you can still use [Weapons](Game/Core/Weapons) as well.
