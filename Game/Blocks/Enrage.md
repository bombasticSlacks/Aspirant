#### Enrage
When you make a [Physique](Core/Strength#Physique) skill test, spend a [Power](Game/Core/Blocks/Power) to become enraged. While enraged, you have:

- +1 [Strength](Core/Strength)
- -1 [Intelligence](Core/Intelligence)
- +2 to [Endurance](Core/Strength#Endurance) tests
- Ignore [Being Wounded](Core/Effects#Wounded)
- Deal +1 [Damage](Game/Core/Weapons#Damage)

On any [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology#Combat%20Turn) where you don't make an [Attack](Core/Terminology#Attack), you must roll a d6, on a 1-3 you stop being enraged.
