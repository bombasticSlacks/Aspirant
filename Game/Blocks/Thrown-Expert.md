### Thrown Expert
*You have a perfect understanding of the weight and dynamics of thrown weapons.*
* If a weapon has the [[Salvageable]] and [[Single-Use]] traits, you always recover the ammo.
* If a weapon has the [[Single-Use]] trait and doesn't have [[Salvageable]] you treat it as though it does.
* Your **favourite weapon** has the [[Throwable]] trait.
* If your **favourite weapon** has [[Area]] it instead counts as having [[Explosion]].
