* If a weapon has the [Salvageable](Game/Core/Blocks/Salvageable) and [Single-Use](Game/Core/Blocks/Single-Use) traits, you always recover the ammo.
* If a weapon has the [Single-Use](Game/Core/Blocks/Single-Use) trait and doesn't have [Salvageable](Game/Core/Blocks/Salvageable) you treat it as though it does.
* Your **favourite weapon** has the [Throwable](Game/Blocks/Throwable) trait.
* If your **favourite weapon** has [Area](Game/Core/Blocks/Area) it instead counts as having [Explosion](Game/Core/Blocks/Explosion).
