### Backstab
*The second someone stops looking at you, you become a problem.*
* After any [Character](Game/Core/Terminology#Character) other than yourself performs a [Successful Attack](Game/Core/Terminology#Successful%20Attack) you may **exploit**.
* When you kill or otherwise incapacitate a character you don't leave evidence behind including a corpse.
