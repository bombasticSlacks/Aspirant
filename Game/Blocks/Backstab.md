### Backstab
*The second someone stops looking at you, you become a problem.*
* After any [[Terminology#Character]] other than yourself performs a [[Terminology#Successful Attack]] you may **exploit**.
* When you kill or otherwise incapacitate a character you don't leave evidence behind including a corpse.
