#### Adrenaline Response
After suffering an [Injury](Core/Injury) that would make you [Wounded](Core/Effects#Wounded), you immediately get to take an additional [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology#Combat%20Turn). After this [Combat Turn](Core/Terminology#Combat%20Turn), you then return to the standard [Action Order](Game/Core/Combat#Action%20Order) ignoring your last action.
