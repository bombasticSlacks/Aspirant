### Borrowed Soul
*The dead dance to your whims.*
* When an entity dies near you you may as an [[Terminology#Action]] to:
	* Have it become a temporary [[Terminology#Ally]], it has no [[Characters#Integrity]], can't be targeted, and disappears after performing 1 [[Terminology#Action]] which it does immediately. 
	* Force it to answer a question to the best of its ability.
	* Have its soul linger for use in rituals.
