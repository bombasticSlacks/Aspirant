### Sweep

As a [Melee Attack](Core/Terminology#Melee%20Attack), you may make a [Physique](Core/Strength#Physique) [Fixed Difficulty](Game/Core/Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(0). If this is a [Non-mitigated Attack](Core/Terminology#Non-mitigated%20Attack), all [Opponents](Core/Terminology#Opponent) within [Reach](Core/Movement#Reach) of you become [Prone](Core/Effects#Prone), they don't otherwise suffer damage.
