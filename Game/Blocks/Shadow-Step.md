### Shadow Step
*You move in and out of combat with ease.*
* After a [[Terminology#Successful Attack]] you may stop being [[In-Melee]].
* When an [[Terminology#Ally]] joins a [[In-Melee]] that you are in, you may stop being [[In-Melee]].
* If a [[Terminology#Character]] is defeated in [[Terminology#Eye Line]] you may teleport to their location, this doesn't count as movement.
