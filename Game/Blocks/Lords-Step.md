### Lords Step
*Your footwork is legendary, only the most skilled combatants can keep up with you and when they fail, you punish them.*
* If you cause a [[Terminology#Mitigated Attack]] while [[In-Melee]], you may become [[Exerted]] to:
	* Have that [[Terminology#Attack]] target someone, other than yourself or the attacker, [[In-Melee]]. The new target may try [[Combat#Defending]] as normal.
	* Perform an [[Terminology#Attack]] on the attacker as a [[Terminology#Free Action]].
