### Lords Step
*Your footwork is legendary, only the most skilled combatants can keep up with you and when they fail, you punish them.*
* If you [[Reacting#Avoid]] an [[Terminology#Attack]] while [[Effects#In Melee]], you may spend another [[Reaction]] to either:
	* Have that [[Terminology#Attack]] target someone, other than yourself or the attacker, [[Effects#In Melee]]. The new target may [[Reacting|React]] as normal.
	* Perform an [[Terminology#Attack]] on the attacker as a [[Terminology#Free Action]].
