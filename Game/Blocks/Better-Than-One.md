### Better Than One
*You can make the most of things, two hands are better than one.*
* While you **overwhelm**, if you perform an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology.md#Action) using only 1 hand you may perform an additional [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) with your second hand as a [Free-Action](Game/Core/Blocks/Free-Action).
