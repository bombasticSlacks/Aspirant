### Money Talks
*You let your money talk for you.*
* Whenever you **haggle** for a service performed you can tip them 1 [[Handling-Equipment#Currency]] and gain a favour they must pay back sometime in the future.
* You and your [[Terminology#Ally]] don't pay for [[Telling-The-Story#Lodgings]].
* You can bribe the target of any [[Connection]] or [[Confidence]] to make it [[Skills#Lucky]]. Bribing costs [[Handling-Equipment#Currency]] equal to the difficulty of the [[Terminology#Skill Test]].
