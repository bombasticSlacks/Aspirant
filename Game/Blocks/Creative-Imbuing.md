When creating [[Magic-Items]] you can also use as a vessel:

| Thing                                             | Size (For costs) |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| A Body Part                                       | 2                |
| A [[Terminology#Character]] | 5                |
| A Place                                           | 5                |
