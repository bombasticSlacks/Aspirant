### Knight
*You are trained to move in the heaviest armour and to protect those that need protection.*
* You consider the [[Armour#Defense Penalty]] on armour as 1 less.
* You may become [[Exerted]] to become the target of an [[Terminology#Attack]] targeting an [[Terminology#Ally]] within [[Movement#Reach]].
* Any [[Terminology#Ally]] within [[Movement#Reach]] of you may, if you allow them, gain the benefit of any [[Terminology#Shield]] you are wielding.
