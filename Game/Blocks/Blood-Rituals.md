### Blood Rituals

* You may attempt a ritual without 1 of the requirements and replace it with an amount of blood.
* If you use your own blood you become [Exerted](Game/Core/Effects#Exerted), this effect isn't removed until you either have a [Good Night's Rest](Game/Activities#Good%20Night's%20Rest) or have [Downtime](Game/Telling-The-Story#Downtime).
