### The Wall
*Your defence is impenetrable, you seem to always be able to avoid anything coming at you.*
* Whenever you perform a successful [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) in [Combat](Game/Core/Combat) you become **the wall**.
* You may stop being **the wall** as a substitute for any time you would spend a [Reaction](Game/Core/Blocks/Reaction).
