### The Wall
*Your defense is impenetrable, you seem to always be able to avoid anything coming at you.*
* Whenever you perform a successful [[Terminology#Action]] in [[Combat]] you become **the wall**.
* You may stop being **the wall** as a substitute for any time a [[Character-Development#Knight]] ability would cause you to be [[Exerted]].
