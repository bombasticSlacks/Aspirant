### Crafter
*You have the spark of creation, you can create things.*
* You can **create**. 
* When you **create** you design your own [[Equipment]] and create things without instruction or reference. 
* You can **create** with [[Materials#Basic]] or [[Materials#Artisan]] [[Materials]].
* Things you **create** require the expected [[Materials]] and a [[Craftsman-Kit]] charge.
