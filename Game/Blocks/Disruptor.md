*You keep even the greatest of foes off balance.*
* When someone would stop being **off balance** you may become [Exerted](Game/Core/Blocks/Exerted) for them to remain **off balance**.
* Enemies that are **off balance** cannot use abilities that require becoming [Exerted](Game/Core/Blocks/Exerted).
