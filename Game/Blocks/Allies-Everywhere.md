### Allies Everywhere
*Your enemies should beware, you have allies everywhere.*
* +1 Max [[Power]].
* When in a location where you have a **contact network** you can
	* Spend a [[Power]] to enter a [[Terminology#Scene]] you were not otherwise in (this might mean the person in the scene you just were in was a body double).
	* Spend a [[Power]] to have non [[Terminology#Player Character]] [[Terminology#Ally]] (relevant to the area) appear in a [[Terminology#Scene]].
