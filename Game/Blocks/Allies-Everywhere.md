### Allies Everywhere
*Your enemies should beware, you have allies everywhere.*

* Spend a **contacts** to enter a [[Terminology#Scene]] you were not otherwise in (this might mean the person in the scene you just were in was a body double).
* Spend a **contacts** to have non [[Terminology#Player Character]] [[Terminology#Ally]] (relevant to the area) appear in a [[Terminology#Scene]].
