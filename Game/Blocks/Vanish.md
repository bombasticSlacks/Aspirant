If within [Reach](Core/Movement#Reach) of something you could use to hide, as a [Free Action](Core/Terminology#Free%20Action) you can spend 2 [Power](Game/Core/Blocks/Power) to lose all attention. If you perform any [Action](Core/Terminology#Action) you will need to continue to hide, move silently, etc. to remain hidden.
