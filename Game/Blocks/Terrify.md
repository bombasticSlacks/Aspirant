#### Terrify
After a [Successful Attack](Core/Terminology#Successful%20Attack) [In Melee](Core/Effects#In%20Melee), you can spend a [Reaction](Game/Core/Blocks/Reaction) to intimidate an enemy with a [Confidence](Game/Core/Communication#Confidence) [Fixed Difficulty](Game/Core/Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(0). If you succeed, they surrender; otherwise, they take a -2 to all actions until your next turn. This is a mind effect for resistance.
