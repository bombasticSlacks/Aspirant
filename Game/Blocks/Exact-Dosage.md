### Exact Dosage
Whenever you administer an alchemical solution with a duration, if the duration is rolled for in rounds, roll twice and take the result of your choice. If the solution's duration is not rolled for, you can choose for it to last either half or twice as long. If the solution's effect is immediate, you can choose to use only half the amount.
