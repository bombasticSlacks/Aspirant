### Range Expert
*You have mastered the mechanical wonders of ranged weaponry, and manipulate them with ease.*
* If your **favourite weapon** has the [[Loading]] trait, reduce its value by 1. If it is already at 0 you receive no penalty to loading and firing as an [[Terminology#Action]].
* If your **favourite weapon** has a [[Weapons#Range]] greater than [[Movement#Reach]], you receive no penalties for attacking outside its range.
* You may spend a [[Power]] to prepare a weapon with [[Loading]] for use as a [[Terminology#Free Action]].
