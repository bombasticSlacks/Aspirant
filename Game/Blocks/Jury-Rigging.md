### Jury Rigging

As a [Travel Activity](Activities#Travel%20Activity) or with significant [Narrative Time](Telling-The-Story#Narrative%20Time), using a [Tinkers Kit](Example-Gear#Tinkers%20Kit), you can construct single-use [Gear](Core/Gear), [Weapons](Core/Weapons), [Comestibles](Core/Comestibles) and other narrative devices using exceptionally basic materials, simpler than would otherwise be allowed with [Application](Core/Intelligence#Application).

The player will need some narrative justification for what they are using, then 1 charge from their [Tinkers Kit](Example-Gear#Tinkers%20Kit).
