### Third Eye
*You can perceive things others cannot.*
* When you [[Awareness]] you can sense things magically within [[Movement#Close]] even if they would otherwise be obfuscated. This information may not be perfect, just as other senses may not be.

> If you were trying to discover enemies and rolled [[Awareness]] near a doorway, you could sense enemies behind the door, how many they are and that they have hostile intent. A GM could flavour this as something like "You feel the souls of 3 humans behind this door, their auras are dark with hatred and ill intent, they are ready for you."
