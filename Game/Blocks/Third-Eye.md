### Third Eye
*You can perceive things others cannot.*
* When you [Awareness](Game/Core/Intuition#Awareness) you can sense things magically within [Close](Game/Core/Movement#Close) even if they would otherwise be obfuscated. This information may not be perfect, just as other senses may not be.

> If you were trying to discover enemies and rolled [Awareness](Game/Core/Intuition#Awareness) near a doorway, you could sense enemies behind the door, how many they are and that they have hostile intent. A GM could flavour this as something like "You feel the souls of 3 humans behind this door, their auras are dark with hatred and ill intent, they are ready for you."
