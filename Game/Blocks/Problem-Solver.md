### Problem Solver
*You know there has to be a way to fix this.*
Sometimes a character will fail an [[Terminology#Action]] in a [[Terminology#Scene]] but really want to succeed or move forward with the goal. In this case the [[Terminology#Player Character]] may opt to make the [[Terminology#Action]] into a Project by spending an **influence**. In this case the [[Terminology#Game Master]] and [[Terminology#Player Character]] should work together to determine why the player failed in the first place, this could be because the character lacks all the information, tools, or materials they need to complete the current action.

> Examples of projects would be, sweet-talking a guard captain into letting you have their troops, powering a device to destroy a magic barrier, coordinating the plan of attack for a massive battle, identifying a creature you are hunting. Treating a king who has come down with a mystery illness.

The [[Terminology#Game Master]] then decides on the difficulty of the project, whether it requires 1, 2, or 3 resolutions to complete. Then in the course of the game the players may use materials, tools, and additional storytelling to complete resolutions. 

If the number of resolutions is met, the [[Terminology#Character]] may complete the project. There is no additional skill test required, after all the initial work, the project will succeed.

> As an example, say a hunter is trying to identify the creature that has been slaughtering farmers' cows. He has [[Memory]] and knowledge of monsters, though he doesn't have many clues to go on yet. After witnessing the injuries on the cows, he makes a skill test to see if he knows of the creature and fails. He really wants to know about the creature and so turns this into a project. The GM determines this is a 1 resolution project. To work on resolving this he needs more info he decides to go into town to ask about strange occurrences.
> After some additional narrative time, the hunter discovers that the creature had avoided a woman wearing a lot of silver jeweler, the GM considers this to be a resolution and lets the player complete the project. 
> As a reward for completion the GM provides the hunter with the information that it is a Werewolf and the abilities and attributes of the creature.
