### Bulk Buyer
*You can take advantage of fluctuations in local markets.*
* Whenever you enter a new place you may spend an [[Influence]] to determine one [[Materials]] that the settlement is lacking and one they have in abundance. If you don't do this the [[Terminology#Game Master]] will decide them. Unless something drastic changes about the world these will be consistent every time you visit this place.
* Once per visit in a place you may:
	* Purchase the abundant material at a 10% discount (rounding total cost down).
	* Sell the lacking material at a 10% markup (rounding total cost up).
