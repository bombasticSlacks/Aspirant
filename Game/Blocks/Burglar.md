### Burglar
*You know how to stay out of sight and out of mind.*
* If within [[Movement#Reach]] of something you could use to hide, as a [[Terminology#Free Action]] you can **vanish**. 
* After you **vanish** everyone loses track of you, isn't aware of you, etc. If you perform any [[Terminology#Action]] you will need to continue to hide, move silently, etc. to remain hidden.
