### Quick Throw
*You always have another tool prepared.*
* Someone who is **off balance** counts as having [Threat](Game/Core/Combat#Threat) 0 against you.
* After you knock someone **off balance** you can perform a [Thrown Attack](Game/Core/Terminology#Thrown%20Attack) as a [Free Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Free%20Action).
