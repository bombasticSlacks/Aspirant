### Trader
*There is a deal around every corner and you are going to find it.*
* You can **haggle**: Once per [[Terminology#Character]] per [[Telling-The-Story#Downtime]] whenever you would spend [[Handling-Equipment#Currency]] you can make a [[Connection]] [[Skills#Variable Difficulty]], for every [[Skills#Step]] of success it costs 1 less [[Handling-Equipment#Currency]]. 
* You can purchase anything, even things someone wouldn't normally willingly sell.
