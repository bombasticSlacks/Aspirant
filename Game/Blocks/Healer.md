### Healer
*You have learned how to perform more invasive medical procedures.*
* You may perform **surgery** on someone who has suffered lasting injuries to treat them. This action cannot be performed in combat and take a few minutes. 
* To do **surgery** spend a [[Healer-Kit]] [[Charges|Charge]], perform [[Gear/Core/Intelligence#Application]].
	* On success removes the person's [[Injured]] [[Effects]]. If you have access to any replacement body parts, or mostly intact severed limbs, they can be reapplied as part of surgery, you can also fix any other effects caused by [[Injury#Injury Damage]].
* **Surgery** can only be attempted once, per person, per [[Gear/Telling-The-Story#Downtime]].
