### Healer
*You have learned how to perform more invasive medical procedures.*
* You may perform **surgery** on someone who has suffered lasting injuries to treat them. This action cannot be performed in combat and take a few minutes. 
* To do **surgery** spend a [Healer-Kit](Game/Gear/Healer-Kit) [Charge](Game/Core/Blocks/Charges), perform [Application](Gear/Core/Intelligence#Application).
	* On success removes the person's [Injured](Game/Core/Blocks/Injured) [Effects](Game/Core/Effects). If you have access to any replacement body parts, or mostly intact severed limbs, they can be reapplied as part of surgery, you can also fix any other effects caused by [Injury Damage](Game/Core/Injury#Injury%20Damage).
* **Surgery** can only be attempted once, per person, per [Downtime](Gear/Telling-The-Story#Downtime).
