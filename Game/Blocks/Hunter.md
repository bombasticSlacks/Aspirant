### Hunter
*You are always on the hunt, what you hunt is easier to defeat.*
* After [Downtime](Game/Telling-The-Story#Downtime) declare your **prey**, you may only have one **prey**. **Prey** may be a specific entity you know of, or a type of creature.
* You deal an additional [Damage](Game/Core/Terminology#Damage) with all [Attack](Game/Core/Terminology#Attack) against **prey**.
* You gain (+1) to all [Memory](Game/Core/Intelligence#Memory) and [Awareness](Game/Core/Instinct#Awareness) skill tests related to **prey**.

> Goblins, Elves, Humans, Spiders, Elementals, would all be valid forms of prey.
