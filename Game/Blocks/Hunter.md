### Hunter
*You are always on the hunt, what you hunt is easier to defeat.*
* After [[Telling-The-Story#Downtime]] declare your **prey**, you may only have one **prey**. **Prey** may be a specific entity you know of, or a type of creature.
* You deal an additional [[Terminology#Damage]] with all [[Terminology#Attack]] against **prey**.
* You gain (+1) to all [[Memory]] and [[Awareness]] skill tests related to **prey**.

> Goblins, Elves, Humans, Spiders, Elementals, would all be valid forms of prey.
