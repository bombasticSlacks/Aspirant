*You can put your thumb gently on the scales of fate.*
* When you get a [Good Night's Rest](Game/Activities#Good%20Night's%20Rest) you **scry**:
* If you own a full Tarot Deck draw two cards and set them aside, you may play those cards for the following bonuses: 
	* You may substitute a [Skill Test](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test) outcome for the value of a numbered card, return it to the deck.
	* You may play a face card to give a [Skill Test](Game/Core/Terminology#Skill%20Test) a (+1), return it to the deck.
	* As an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action) or [Reaction](Game/Core/Reacting) you can play a major tarot card and interpret what it means for the outcome of an [Action](Game/Core/Terminology#Action).
