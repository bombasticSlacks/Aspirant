### Fate Weaver
#TODO need to move to own class
*You can put your thumb gently on the scales of fate.*
* When you get a [[Activities#Good Night's Rest]] you **scry**:
* If you own a full Tarot Deck draw two cards and set them aside, you may play those cards for the following bonuses: 
	* You may substitute a [[Terminology#Skill Test]] outcome for the value of a numbered card, return it to the deck.
	* You may play a face card to give a [[Terminology#Skill Test]] a (+1), return it to the deck.
	* As an [[Terminology#Action]] or [[Reacting|Reaction]] you can play a major tarot card and interpret what it means for the outcome of an [[Terminology#Action]].
