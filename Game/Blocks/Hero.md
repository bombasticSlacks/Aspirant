### Hero
*You matter and shape the world.*

Heroes should help make the game a shared experience. So, when you play, the  [[Terminology#Game Master]]may ask you for suggestions or to volunteer ideas such as: “what is this town known for?”, “someone give me a cool female name.”. When these are accepted by the [[Terminology#Game Master]], you receive 1 **influence** which you can spend to **influence** the game world in any way the GM allows. When you want to influence the world:

- You will ask the [[Terminology#Game Master]], “Can this thing be the case?”
- The  [[Terminology#Game Master]]will deliberate and assign an influence cost required “For it to be so you will need to spend X influence.”
- Then you and any  [[Terminology#Player Character]] who would like to contribute can spend the required influence to make this happen.
- If you don’t have the influence, feel free to try to negotiate for something similarly useful to your character or of interest.

> So as an example, if you wanted to train a specific duellist training you could have this conversation:

> Player 1: “What if there is a travelling master swordsman moving through this town?”

> GM: “hmm that isn’t too far-fetched I’ll allow a master duellist to be travelling through for 4 influence, or how about it’s a journeyman, but they know the training you want for 2 influence?”

> Player 2: “I’ll pitch in the extra 2 influences for the master! Maybe we can hire them to help with our next job!”

> Player 1: “Sure sounds good.”

> GM: “Great, spend 2 influence each, now tell me more about this swordsman. What is their name? What are they doing here?”

Remember, as a [[Terminology#Game Master]], this system is designed to get your players involved in building the world. Costs aren’t provided here since different  [[Terminology#Game Master]]will ask their players more or less for help building the world, but some opportunity to shape it should be provided.
