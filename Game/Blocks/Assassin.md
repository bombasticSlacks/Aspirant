### Assassin
*You take every opportunity to exploit your enemies and leverage your allies.*
* After any [[Terminology#Ally]] performs a [[Terminology#Successful Attack]] you may **exploit**.
* When you **exploit** spend a [[Reaction]] to preform an [[Terminology#Attack]] with a size 1 weapon as a [[Terminology#Free Action]].
* If you perform a [[Terminology#Successful Attack]] on a target that isn't aware of you with a size one weapon you may perform another [[Terminology#Attack]] as a [[Terminology#Free Action]].
