At the beginning of any combat encounter, you can name a character who you think will be injured during the encounter. Any medical tests you make on that person during and after this combat gets a +3. The person you select also gets +1 to [Identity](Game/Core/Spirit#Identity) skill tests for the duration of the encounter.
