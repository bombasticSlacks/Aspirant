### I Packed It

Once per [Downtime](Game/Telling-The-Story#Downtime), you can declare after the fact that you purchased an item while you were last resting in a settlement. The item would have to have been available, and you need to spend the equivalent currency it would have cost.

You also count as having an [Explorers Kit](Game/Example-Gear#Explorers%20Kit), you can use it for [Power](Game/Core/Blocks/Power) instead of silver.
