### I Packed It
*You always seem prepared, no matter how careful you are with your money.*
* You can spend an [[Influence]] to [[Telling-The-Story#Flashback]] at anytime to you purchasing something in the last place you visited. The item would have to have been available, and you need to spend the equivalent currency it would have cost. After the [[Telling-The-Story#Flashback]] you have the object on hand.
