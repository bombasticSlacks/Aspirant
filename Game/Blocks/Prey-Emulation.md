### Prey Emulation
*You have learned how to mimic your preys abilities and skills to deadly effect.*
* While your **prey** is present in the [[Terminology#Scene]] you may become **exerted** to use any of its abilities, even magical ones.
* You may destroy a [[Bits|Bit]] harvested from a monster to gain the use of one of its abilities freely until the [[Terminology#Scene]] ends.
