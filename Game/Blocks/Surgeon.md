### Surgeon
You may perform surgery on someone who has suffered lasting injuries to treat them. 

Surgery, at a minimum, requires a flat surface and [Surgeons Tool Set](Gear/Example-Gear#Surgeons%20Tool%20Set). It is a [Application](Gear/Core/Intelligence#Application) [Opposed Difficulty](Gear/Core/Skills#Opposed%20Difficulty)([Long Term Injury](Gear/Core/Effects#Long%20Term%20Injury)), you receive a:
* (+2) for a sterile environment.
* (+1) for monitoring equipment. 
A successful surgery removes the person's [Long Term Injury](Gear/Core/Effects#Long%20Term%20Injury). If you have access to any replacement body parts, or mostly intact severed limbs, they can be reapplied as part of surgery. 

Surgery takes 20 minutes per [Injury](Gear/Core/Injury) the person has sustained, with [Vitals](Gear/Core/Injury#Vitals) injuries taking twice as long. The total time in surgery is equal to the sum of all injuries. 

Surgery can only be attempted once, per person, per [Downtime](Gear/Telling-The-Story#Downtime).
