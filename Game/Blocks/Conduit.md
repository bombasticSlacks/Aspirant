*You are sensitive to shifts in magic, and can obsorb great amounts of power.*
* You always know if something is magical in nature.
* When performing [[Spirit]] you may opt to automatically succeed on a skill test and on the following table to see what happens to you:

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
