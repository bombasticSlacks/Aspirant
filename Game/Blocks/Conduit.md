### Conduit
*You are sensitive to shifts in magic, and can absorb great amounts of power.*
* You always know if something is magical in nature.
* When performing [[Spirit]] you may opt to automatically succeed on a skill test and on the following table to see what happens to you:

| 1d6 | Outcome                                                  |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Suffer 4 [[Terminology#Damage]] and you are [[On-Fire]]. |
| 2-3 | Suffer 4 [[Terminology#Damage]].                         |
| 4-5 | Nothing Happens.                                         |
