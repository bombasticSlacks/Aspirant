#### Clothesline
If an [Opponent](Core/Terminology#Opponent) moves within [Reach](Core/Movement#Reach) of you, you may spend a [Reaction](Game/Core/Blocks/Reaction) to make a [Physique](Core/Strength#Physique) [Fixed Difficulty](Game/Core/Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty)(0), that if successful causes their attack to fail and knocks them prone.

This doesn't work against enemies immune to being [Prone](Game/Core/Effects#Prone).
