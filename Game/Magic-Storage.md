### Harmonic Bags

#### Inverting Backpack
*You've cosmically entwined two backpacks. Each exists now as the inversion of the other.*
* Requires a second backpack to enchant. 
* You count as wearing both but need to spend 15 seconds flipping your current inside out.

#### Saddle Tunnel
*A compartment exists at the bottom of your bag that leads all the way to your saddlebags.*
* You can access your saddlebags any time you have your backpack. 
* Your bag always smells like your mount. 

#### Bag Of Holding
*This container is bigger on the inside.*
* This container is only 1 size no matter the size it holds. 
* This container can't be placed in another enchanted bag or it's destroyed.

#### Cosmic Sheath
*A loop filled with darkness hangs from your belt.*
* Your belt can hold one additional item of any size.
* Your belt jingles with a distant echo.
