# Bits
One of the [[Materials]] used for crafting and trading.

After killing a creature you can, unless it’s been annihilated, usually [[Equipment#Looting]] some bits. Bits are a generalization of organs, glands, bones, and other valuables. Your character would intuitively know what parts of a creature are valuable, even if you don’t yet. 

## Basic Bits
Simple unimpressive creature viscera, not useful for much more than cooking or filler.

> Blood, mundane organs, bones

## Artisan Bits
Purposeful materials from creatures with clearly developed biological systems doing useful things.

> An undead creature's ichor, the claws of a powerful predator, eyes of a creature that can see in the dark

## Exotic Bits
Similarly highly developed biological systems, but doing truly incredible things.

> The regenerating heart of a golem, the blood of an elder vampire, the fire spewing lungs of a dragon.
