### Basic
#### Autodoc
You can perform invasive surgery on yourself and ignore your own injuries when using the medicine skill on yourself.

#### Bedside Manner
You receive a +2 on all social interactions with people you have treated since last downtime, and a +1 on all medical tests with people that like you.

#### Do No Harm
You receive a +1 to all non-combat skill tests, however to directly harm another thing, you need to first roll a RES test.

#### Doctors Eye
You can always tell how injured a person is (and where). It takes much less time for you to diagnose an illness or unknown condition.

#### On Ice
You have twice as long to perform medical skill tests on characters before it becomes impossible.

#### Shaman
#TODOcopy 
You can perform medicine tests without relevant tools at a -1. For any specific medical tests, you count as having the tools, surgery, for example.

#### Speculative Medicine
At the beginning of any combat encounter, you can name a character who you think will be injured during the encounter. Any medical tests you make on that person during and after this combat gets a +3. The person you select also gets +1 to [Heroism](Stats#Heroism) for the duration of the encounter.

#### Surgeon
#TODOcopy 
You can perform surgery on people.

#### Sword Surgeon
When making skill tests with a rending weapon, you may substitute your medicine skill for melee skill.

#TODOcopy 
If you successfully perform first aid on someone, they no longer have any ongoing negatives from injuries. You can also make a medical test to treat ongoing negatives that were caused by someone else's medical work.

### Master

#### Playing God
#TODOcopy 
You do not critically fail surgery skill tests on a dice roll of 2. You can attempt to bring someone who has died from either a critical chest wound, critical wound to the head, or who has received a lethal injury back to life. This is a single medical test you can only perform once, and anyone aiding you must also have Playing God. It must be performed within 10 minutes of the injury occurring and requires surgical tools and a trauma kit. The test is at a -3 for a chest wound, -5 for a head wound and -7 for a lethal injury. Reduce the difficulty of this test by 2 if you have access to full medical facilities.|
