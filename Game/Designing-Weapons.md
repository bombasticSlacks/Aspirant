## Designing [Weapons](Weapons)
Through play and when creating a character, you may be asked to select a weapon. You can use one of the sample weapons further in this chapter or design your own. Perhaps your village has a unique weapon, or a blacksmith has an idea for a unique weapon. 

To build a weapon:
- Choose the [Quality](Weapons#Quality)
- Choose a [Size](Weapons#Size)
- Select a [Damage Type](Weapons#Damage%20Type)
- Select a number of [Weapon Traits](Weapon-Traits) for the weapon equal to the amount available based on [Quality](Weapons#Quality)

### Material
Generally, weapons material isn’t particularly important. Cheap materials will not be usable for martial weapons, simple but quality materials will not be usable for exotic/master worked weapons. [Costs Of Materials](Services#Costs%20Of%20Materials) has details on the crafting capacity and cost of different materials.

One benefit to exotic materials, however, is their potential for harming monsters. A sword made of silver might be known to harm werewolves, a spear made from elven wood is effective against wraiths, etc. In some exceptional cases, a material may provide a trait for free, increase damage bonus, or provide some skill bonus. 

### Crafting
A character looking to craft a specific weapon first requires 2x the size worth of materials and [Craftsman](Craftsman) training saying they are able to make what they want. So, a silver sword of size 3 would require 6 size worth of pure silver, or 60 silver coins. Other bits, unless narratively relevant, are a negligible portion of the cost. Then, the character, as a downtime activity, may spend a day crafting. If they succeed on the [Crafting](Crafting) test, the item is created successfully. If not, they must try again in the future, however materials are not lost, just time. 

The difficulty of the test is modified as follows:
* Traits -1 per each
* Exotic Materials -1
* Poor facilities -1
