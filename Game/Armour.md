## Armour
Armour [[Equipment]] is your character's safety net. It is designed to protect against only a small amount of high-powered attacks. However, advanced armour can be almost impervious to simpler weapons. Armour will protect certain locations on your body. A suit of armour together has shared integrity, but separate details for each location it protects on your body. Some armours will stack, such as shields and energy fields. If you have multiple valid armour sources, you can choose to use whichever you want (though only 1 per attack).

### Locations
Armour is separated into 4 distinct sections. Head, Torso, arms, legs.

### Values
Armour is made of specific materials which have 4 distinct attributes: Weakness, Resistance, Structure, Max Skill. 

#### Max Skill
affects different locations separately and is the maximum bonus you can have on related skill tests before negatives are applied. 

| Location | Skills effected                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Head     | [Perception](Perception), [Perform](Perform.md), and [Converse](Converse)    |
| Arms     | [Melee](Melee), [Marksmanship](Marksmanship), [Channel](Channel), and [Ritual](Ritual) |
| Torso    | *No Penalties*                                 |
| Legs     | [Acrobatics](Acrobatics), [Subterfuge](Subterfuge)                                               |

#### Weakness and Resistance
Changes how certain [types of damage](Combat#Types%20of%20Damage) effect you. See [dealing damage](Combat#Dealing%20Damage) for details.

#### Structure
Contributes to your overall armours integrity. Allowing it to take more hits before becoming non-functional.

### Style
Characters shouldn’t be punished for dressing their characters in a specific way that doesn’t describe perfect protection. The most obvious, however dated, example is a chain mail bikini. Though silly and perhaps not something players would be comfortable with, if it is in your game, it counts as fully functional armour with similar weaknesses to any other armour of similar material. Players and, in most cases, NPCs should not have their narrative armour exploited.  

This extends to hats and helmets as well. Many players love the idea of a hero with their hair flowing in the wind and a perfect smile as they rush into battle. This vision doesn’t need to conflict with having a protected head. Characters could have headbands, thinly framed helmets, or even a high coif / scarf. These give the impression of head armour without giving up the vision of a hero.

### Master Work
Master worked armour is identical to a standard armour piece, except it has one less weakness. Armour with no weaknesses instead gains +1 skill bonus.

### Armour Integrity
Your overall suit of armour will have an armour integrity, which is how well it all comes together to protect you. In other words, your armour suit has a shared amount of health over all locations. To calculate your suit of armour's integrity, add the structure values of all your armour pieces together. All armour suits no matter the pieces have at least 2 points of integrity, and for every 10 total structure value you get an additional point of armour integrity. 

> For example, a character with 4 pieces of leather gives 8 structure, looking at the tens' digit (0) gives the minimum value for armour, an integrity of 2.

> A character with 2 pieces of leather (2 structure each) and 3 pieces of plate mail (6 each) has 24 total structure, looking at the ten's digit (2), that's an overall armour integrity of 4.
