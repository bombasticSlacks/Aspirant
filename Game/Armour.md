# Armour
Armour [Equipment](Equipment) is your character's safety net. It is designed to protect against only a small amount of high-powered attacks. However, advanced armour can be almost impervious to simpler weapons. Armour will protect certain locations on your body. A suit of armour together has shared integrity, but separate details for each location it protects on your body. Some armours will stack, such as shields and energy fields. If you have multiple valid armour sources, you can choose to use whichever you want (though only 1 per attack).

## Locations
Armour is separated into 2 distinct sections. [Ancillary](Injury#Ancillary), [Vitals](Injury#Vitals).

## Materials
Armour is made of specific [materials](materials) which have 4 distinct attributes: [Weakness and Resistance](#Weakness%20and%20Resistance), [Armour Integrity](#Armour%20Integrity), [Max Skill](#Skill%20Penalty). To function as protection, a piece of armour must be made of at least [Artisan](Materials#Artisan) quality materials, even if it is of a Basic design. Materials also influence which [Armour-Traits](Armour-Traits) are available for Artisan and Exotic armours.

## Skill Penalty
Wearing armour affects your ability to fight in combat. Heavier armour, though offering more protection, will affect the [Difficulty Value](Terminology#Difficulty%20Value) of certain actions as shown below.

| Location                      | Skills effected                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| [Ancillary](Injury#Ancillary) | [Attacks](Terminology#Attack)    |
| [Vitals](Injury#Vitals)       | [Reactions](Terminology#Reaction) | 

## Weakness and Resistance
Some armour will be more susceptible or less susceptible to certain [Types of Damage](Injury#Types%20of%20Damage).
* If you are weak to an attack, increase the damage by 1.
* If you are resistant to an attack, reduce the damage by 1.

If a piece of armour would gain a resistance or weakness complementary to an existing Resistance or Weakness on the armour through [Armour-Traits](Armour-Traits), the two cancel out, resulting in no effect. If a piece of armour would gain a resistance or weakness it already has through [Armour-Traits](Armour-Traits), there is no effect. 

## Quality
Armour can come in various qualities. Higher quality armours gain access to [Armour-Traits](Armour-Traits) as well as the ability to incorporate additional [materials](materials) into their design. [Designing Armour](Designing-Armour) has more details on the specifics.

## Armour Integrity
Your overall suit of armour will have an armour integrity, which is how well it all comes together to protect you. In other words, your armour suit has a shared amount of health over all locations. Armour Integrity is equal to the values of your [Vitals](Injury#Vitals) coverage + [Ancillary](Injury#Ancillary) coverage. 

## Style
Characters shouldn’t be punished for dressing their characters in a specific way that doesn’t describe perfect protection. The most obvious, however dated, example is a chain mail bikini. Though silly and perhaps not something players would be comfortable with, if it is in your game, it counts as fully functional armour with similar weaknesses to any other armour of similar material. Players and, in most cases, NPC characters should not have their narrative armour exploited.  

This extends to hats and helmets as well. Many players love the idea of a hero with their hair flowing in the wind and a perfect smile as they rush into battle. This vision doesn’t need to conflict with having a protected head. Characters could have headbands, thinly framed helmets, or even a high coif / scarf. These give the impression of head armour without giving up the vision of a hero.
