## Craftsman
One of the 8 [Trades Training](Trades-Training) disciplines.

An artisan, working to produce high-quality goods manually. People with craftsman training will be: repairers, tradesmen, smiths and tinkerers. 

### Basic

#### Weapon Smithing
As [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work), using a [Weapons Tool Set](Example-Gear#Weapons%20Tool%20Set) you can use [Science](Science) to craft [Basic](Designing-Weapons#Basic) and [Artisan](Designing-Weapons#Artisan) weapons, more details are available in [Designing-Weapons](Designing-Weapons). 

You can also as [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work) craft [Munitions](Comestibles#Munitions) using [Science](Science). This costs half the price as the ammo normally would, and you can create up to 10 per [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work).

#### Exotic Crafting
When crafting you can use [Exotic](Materials#Exotic) [Materials](Materials) and make exotic [Equipment](Equipment).

#### Naturalist
You don’t need a tool kit to do [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work), however any skill tests are at a -1.

#### Recycler
When crafting a weapon, instead of providing materials, you may provide another weapon of equivalent size and materials to transform into the new weapon.

#### Simple Repairs
As [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work), you can repair a damaged item or up to 5 rounds of ammunition. This requires a [Weapons Tool Set](Example-Gear#Weapons%20Tool%20Set), but no additional materials or currency.

#### Ablative Armour
After downtime, your armour has 2 additional max integrity that isn’t otherwise repairable.

#### Armour Smith
As [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work), you can craft or modify [Basic](Designing-Armour#Basic) and [Artisan](Designing-Armour#Artisan) [Armour](Armour) using an [Armourers Tool Set](Example-Gear#Armourers%20Tool%20Set) using [Science](Science). More details in [Designing-Armour](Designing-Armour).

You can also as [Production Work](Activities#Production%20Work) craft and modify storage items using [Science](Science), more details in [Designing-Storage](Designing-Storage).

#### Routine Maintenance
As a [Travel Activity](Activities#Travel%20Activity) you may repair 2 points of armour integrity to each ally's armour. Each ally's weapon deals 1 additional damage until the next [Travel Segment](Telling-The-Story#Travel%20Segment).

#### Weak Spot
You know the Armour Integrity, weakness, and resistance of any character's armour that you can see.

#### Specialized Tools
As a [Travel Activity](Activities#Travel%20Activity), you can select a specific [Toolkit](Gear#Toolkits) to prepare. When using that tool kit during the next [Travel Segment](Telling-The-Story#Travel%20Segment), you get a +2 to all skill tests.

### Advanced
#### Custom Job
Any weapon you craft for personal use can have one additional trait. Anyone else using this weapon suffers a -2 to skill tests and does not benefit from the additional trait.

#### Efficient Patterns
When crafting [Equipment](Equipment), you require one less size worth of materials.

#### Integrated Weapons
Up to two of your weapons of size 3 or less are integrated into your armour / clothing. They cannot be dropped, are concealed, and don’t take up space.

#### Jury Rigging
As a [Travel Activity](Activities#Travel%20Activity) or with significant [Narrative Time](Telling-The-Story#Narrative%20Time), using a [Tinkers Kit](Example-Gear#Tinkers%20Kit), you can construct single-use [Gear](Gear), [Weapons](Weapons), [Comestibles](Comestibles) and other narrative devices using exceptionally basic materials, simpler than would otherwise be allowed with [Science](Science).

The player will need some narrative justification for what they are using, then 1 charge from their [Tinkers Kit](Example-Gear#Tinkers%20Kit).

### Master

#### Masters Touch
[Equipment](Equipment) you create in a [Workshop](Example-Infrastructure#Workshop) are masterwork quality.
