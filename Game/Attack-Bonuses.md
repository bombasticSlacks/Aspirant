## Attack Bonuses
These are common bonuses and negatives you can receive on your attacks which will make attacking easier. This is not an exhaustive list and sometimes, if you feel you are advantaged over your opponent, you should express this to your GM, and they may give you additional bonuses. As well, some combat bonuses can be learned by taking specific combat training, or having specific pieces of equipment.
### Charging
When making a melee attack or manoeuvre, if you have moved at least 3 meters towards your opponent you get a +1 to the skill test.
### Shooting Position
If when shooting you are in a comfortable position you get a +1 to the skill test.
### Outnumbered
If your opponent is outnumbered in melee, you receive a +1 to melee attacks and manoeuvres against them.
### Severely Outnumbered
If your opponents are outnumbered in melee by more than 2 to 1 you receive a +2 to melee attacks and manoeuvres against them. (ex: 3 to 1, 5 to 2 etc.).
### Unaware
When making an attack or manoeuvre, if your opponent is unaware of your presence, you get a +4 to the skill test.
### On The Move
If you have moved this turn, you take a -2 to attacks and manoeuvres.
### Unweighted for Throwing
If you attempt to throw a weapon that doesnâ€™t have the thrown tag you receive a -3 on the skill test. Basic weapons only have a -1 penalty.
### On Your Back
When attempting a melee test, if you are prone, you receive a -2.
### Distance Penalty
When you fire a ranged weapon if you are outside the range, you suffer a -1 per range they are away from you.

> So if you have a range of 10m and are attacking 35 meters away, you suffer a -3.
