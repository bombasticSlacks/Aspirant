# Assets
Asset [Equipment](Core/Equipment) is your more abstract holdings. If you own a house, business, manage a keep etc. Some of these will require active management to maintain, or have maintenance costs and potential earnings. 

## Locations
#TODOcopy 

## Camp Equipment
These are large pieces of equipment, machines, or other things that could assist your characters but can't be taken directly into danger. These will provide benefits to travel or to characters in camp.

Camp equipment cannot be stored in [General Storage](Game/Storage#General%20Storage), only [Camp Storage](Game/Storage#Camp%20Storage).

## Vehicles
These are large structures that can be pulled, or carried. 

## Allies
Some [Ally](Game/Core/Terminology#Ally) could be considered assets if they assist with certain things in and around [Downtime](Game/Telling-The-Story#Downtime) and [Travelling](Game/Telling-The-Story#Travelling). 
> Saddled horses, a regiment of guards standing watch while you sleep, a bard who tells stories by the campfire would be examples.
