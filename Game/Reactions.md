## Reacting to Attacks
During each full turn of combat, each character gets a single , which they can use when something else happens during combat. Your reaction refreshes on your turn. In general, these are used to avoid incoming attacks. The generally available reactions are:

### Avoid
A [Reflexes](Agility#Reflexes) skill test at a -2 where if you succeed, you ignore the effects of the attack unless otherwise specified.

### Move to Cover
A [Grace](Agility#Grace) skill test where if you succeed then you may move to a piece of cover within agility meters before an enemy ranged attack is calculated. You cannot Move to Cover while prone.

### Attack of Opportunity
A [Strike](Strength#Strike) skill test at (-2) which you may perform if someone moves while [in melee](#Being%20in%20Melee%20Combat) with you. If successful, you can resolve an attack against them, which they cannot dodge.

### All Out Attack
Declare that you forgo your reaction for the turn to get a +2 on an action on your turn.
