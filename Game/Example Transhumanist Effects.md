| Universal Tongue     | The tongue of an extra dimensional creature lives in your mouth. Your jaw moves in an unnatural way barely synchronized with your words.                                               | You inherently speak and understand all languages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Weighted Limbs       | Your arms and legs have been weighted and reinforced making your unarmed attacks very dangerous.                                                                                       | Your unarmed attacks deal +2 damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Wraith               | Your body seems to move on its own and in strange directions as though you are exploding from the inside.                                                                              | You may move freely in any direction at your regular movement speed and can levitate/hover at will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
