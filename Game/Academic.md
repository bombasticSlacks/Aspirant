Academics are: 
* Teachers

They can generally teach the following training:

### Basic

#### Autodoc
You can perform invasive [Surgeon](#Surgeon) work on yourself and ignore your own [Injury Penalty](Injury#Injury%20Penalty) when performing [Application](Intelligence#Application) skill tests.

#### Doctors Eye
You can always tell how injured a person is (and where). When starting a health/medicine related [Project](Skills#Project) you always succeed with at least 1 [Step Of Success](Skills#Step%20Of%20Success).

#### On Ice
You have twice as long to perform [Managing Injuries](Injury#Managing%20Injuries) skill tests on characters before it becomes impossible.

#### Holistic Tools
You can perform [Application](Intelligence#Application) skill tests without needing any tools or kits; however, you receive a (-2) to related [Action](Terminology#Action) while not having appropriate gear.

#### Speculative Medicine
At the beginning of any combat encounter, you can name a character who you think will be injured during the encounter. Any medical tests you make on that person during and after this combat gets a +3. The person you select also gets +1 to [Identity](Spirit#Identity) skill tests for the duration of the encounter.

#### Sword Surgeon
While holding a rending weapon you can [Substitute](Terminology#Substitute) [Application](Intelligence#Application) for [Strike](Strength#Strike).

#### Long Term Care
As a [Travel Activity](Activities#Travel%20Activity) you can declare you are going to heal peoples wounds. Your [Allies](Terminology#Ally) traveling with you can perform the [Injury Recovery](Activities#Injury%20Recovery) action.

### Advanced

#### Do No Harm
You receive a (+1) to all [Non-Combat](Terminology#Non-Combat) [Actions](Terminology#Action), however to directly harm another [Character](Terminology#Character), you need to succeed an [Identity](Spirit#Identity) [Fixed Difficulty(0)](Skills#Fixed%20Difficulty).

#### Surgeon
You may perform surgery on someone who has suffered lasting injuries to treat them. 

Surgery, at a minimum, requires a flat surface and [Surgeons Tool Set](Example-Gear#Surgeons%20Tool%20Set). It is a [Application](Intelligence#Application) [Opposed Difficulty](Skills#Opposed%20Difficulty)([Injury Penalty](Injury#Injury%20Penalty)), you receive a:
* (+2) for a sterile environment.
* (+1) for monitoring equipment. 
A successful surgery removes the person's [Injury Penalty](Injury#Injury%20Penalty). If you have access to any replacement body parts, or mostly intact severed limbs, they can be reapplied as part of surgery. 

Surgery takes 20 minutes per [Injury](Injury) the person has sustained, with torso injuries #TODODamage taking 2 times as long and head injuries taking 3 times as long. The total time in surgery is equal to the sum of all injuries. 

Surgery can only be attempted once, per person, per downtime.

### Master

#### Playing God
*[Requirement](Terminology#Requirement): [Surgeon](#Surgeon)*
You cannot have [Critical Failure](Skills#Critical%20Failure) in surgery. 

You can also attempt to bring someone who has died from either a critical chest wound, critical wound to the head, or who has received a lethal injury back to life #TODODamage. This is a single medical test you can only perform once, and anyone [Aiding](Skills#Aid%20and%20Hindrance) you must also have Playing God. It must be performed within 10 minutes of the injury occurring and is surgery.

#### Trauma Doc
If you successfully use a [Trauma Kit](Example-Gear#Trauma%20Kit) on someone, their [Injury Penalty](Injury#Injury%20Penalty) goes away. You can also make a medical test to treat ongoing negatives that were caused by someone else's medical work.
