## Designing [Storage](Storage)

### Crafting Storage
Efficient storage requires numerous small latches and fixings and meticulous tailored pieces to come together into a functional piece. General costs for crafting different pieces of storage are as follows:
* Belts: Base cost of 10 silver for 4 units of storage.
* Bags: Base cost of 5 silver for 6 units of storage.
* Saddlebags: Base cost of 10 silver for 10 units of storage

Every type of storage can have up to 4 additional size.

| Additional Size Of Storage | Cost |
| -------------------------- | ---- |
| 1                          | 5    |
| 2                          | 10   |
| 3                          | 20   |
| 4                          | 30   |

> So, a Belt with 6 storage would cost 10 silver for the base plus 10 silver for the additional 2 size of storage.

### Customized Storage
Any bag can have its storage customized for a specific thing. This activity takes a tailor a day and allows you to convert 1 size of generic storage into 2 size of specialized storage or the other way. The types of specialized storage are: 
* [Bits](Resources#Bits)
* [Munitions](Comestibles#Munitions)
* [Weapons](Weapons) 
* [Alchemy](Comestibles#Alchemy)
* [Toolkits](Gear#Toolkits)
* [Currency](Equipment#Currency)  
Only items of that type can be stored in the related specialized storage.
