# Designing [[Storage]]

## Crafting Storage
Efficient storage requires numerous small latches and fixings and meticulous tailored pieces to come together into a functional piece.

To design a piece of storage:
1. Choose the [[#Quality|Quality]].
2. Take [[#Tradeoffs|Tradeoffs]].
3. Select [[#Features|Features]].
4. [[#Calculate Storage|Calculate Storage]]
## Quality
Storage come in a variety of qualities based on the skill and material used to craft.
### Basic
*Basic storage are simple sets of functional bags, satchels, belts and loops.*
* Uses materials of at least [[Materials#Basic]] quality.
* Has the stats of [[Basic-Storage]].

### Artisan
*Artisan storage is properly built and designed to better support travelers.*
* Uses materials of at least [[Materials#Artisan]] quality.
* Have 1 [[#Features|Features]]
* May take 1 [[#Tradeoffs|Tradeoffs]]

### Exotic
*Exotic storage uses the unique properties of materials to make incredible tools.* 
* Uses materials of at least [[Materials#Exotic]] quality.
* Have 2 [[#Features|Features]].
* May take 1 [[#Tradeoffs|Tradeoffs]].

### Master Work
*A masterful crafter can do a lot to imbue an item with additional power and versatility.* 
* A masterwork storage has +1 [[#Features|Features]].
* May take 2 [[#Tradeoffs|Tradeoffs]]. 
### Relic
Strange or enchanted [[Storage]], these can be anything you want but should have special rules for crafting or acquiring, more so then a simple skill test.

## Tradeoffs
Some storage sacrifices in one way to gain power in another. For each tradeoff you do you gain an additional [[#Features|Features]]. Tradeoffs are (can be selected more than once):
- -4 [[Storage#Camp Storage]]
- -2 [[Storage#Quick Access]]
- -2 [[Storage#General Storage]]
## Features
 Can be spent to further modify storage. Features are (each selectable more than once):
 * +4 [[Storage#Camp Storage]]
 * +2 [[Storage#Quick Access]]
 * +2 [[Storage#General Storage]]
 * +1 [[Storage#Specialization]], -2 [[Storage#General Storage]]
 * Add an [[Storage-Traits]] that can be justified based on the storage.

## Calculate Storage
After you have selected [[#Tradeoffs|Tradeoffs]] and [[#Features|Features]] apply them to the base values of:

| [[Storage#General Storage]] | 8 + [[Strength]] |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [[Storage#Quick Access]]       | 4                                  |
| [[Storage#Camp Storage]]       | 8                                  |
| [[Storage#Specialization]]     | -                                  |

## Crafting Costs
Generally creating storage requires 6 size of a material of at least the specified quality.
