## Fellowship
### Speaking
Identical to converse, just interfacing also would include one - way conversation, or written word

Exact same

Exact same as perform, however this tends to be used in more direct "lying" situations so duplicity includes that more directly.

No longer includes instrumental performance, which is better covered with Accuracy

## Resolve
### Will
The Same as channelling, inflicting your will on the world around you.

### Attunement
Exact same as ritual, but it's a less clunky word, and also I think better clarifies that rituals are about connecting to the world around you and influencing it, rather than changing it completely.
